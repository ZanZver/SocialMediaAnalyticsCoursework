\subsection{Reddit}\label{Reddit}

Reddit API \parencite{web:Reddit} is free to use (in the time of writing) and it only requires user to create an account. There are different datasets available as well, for this report subredit datasets have been used in order to get specific set of data. 

Topics (subredits) that were checked are crypto related (r/eth, r/btc, r/crypto). Data is gathered in two ways for each of the subreddits, by new and top in order to see the difference between them.

The Reddit data is used in two sections (A1, B1). Section A1 focuses in data analysis, therefore data with numeric properties was prioritised. B1 focuses on text analytic, therefore only text data is used. Figures bellow showcase what columns are used in each section
