Investigating top words, we can see that Ethereum is top mentioned word, but bitcoin is there as well. This is not surprising since bitcoin is the most popular (and well known) crypto currency. Besides that, there are other related words such as NFT, blockchain, fee, etc... that are used in the context of crypto currency topics.
