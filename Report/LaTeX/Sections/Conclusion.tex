\section{Conclusions}

Text mining is a powerful technique in order to analyse not just web data but user data as well. We can see how real world trends effect user behaviour. 

With the rise of new technologies (such as ChatGPT and Google Bard), we need to be careful as users and as researchers. Internet is source of information for those models and there is a lot of misinformation on it. If input data is false, we could be reading false information generated from these models.

With simple Python tools and few APIs, we can get much more data as demonstrated. This could be extended by linking to other social media websites and create "whats hot" model that could get us key topics in crypto or in general.
