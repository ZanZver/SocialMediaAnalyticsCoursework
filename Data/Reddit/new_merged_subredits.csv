However, reporting your cryptocurrency losses can help you save a ton of money in taxes. *(Disclaimer: I'm not a tax professional and you should do your own research before you sell your crypto/file your taxes. )***What's the benefit of reporting crypto losses?** When you realize losses in crypto, you can offset capital gains from cryptocurrency, stocks, and other assets as well as up to $3,000 of income for the year! If you have a net loss for the year, you can even offset capital gains in future years. Let's say you lost $100,000 in 2022 (I really hope this didn't happen to anyone reading this). In this case, you can write off $3,000 of income this year and carry forward $97,000 of loss to write off gains in future years! This can save you a HUGE amount in taxes if you end up taking profits during the next bull run. **What do you mean by realized' loss?** A realized' loss basically just means you disposed of your cryptocurrency for a lower price than it was when you originally acquired it. Examples of disposals include selling your cryptocurrency, trading it for another crypto, or using your cryptocurrency to make a purchase. If you just held your cryptocurrency for all of last year, you didn't realize' a loss. Unfortunately, that means you can't write off your loss on your tax return. **But, reporting my crypto losses sounds like way too much work!'** There's no reason not to report your capital losses on your taxes. If you're using a crypto tax platform (like [CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), Koinly, CoinTracker, or whatever else is out there now), it should only take a few minutes.

Many believe that large-scale ticketing giants have held a monopoly on event hosting for the world's cr√®me de la cr√®me. But I think the only answer to all issues related to tickets is NFTs.  The issues with the global ticketing industry are well-documented at this point. Bot-based tech has us fighting due to dynamic pricing and getting into a mode of panic buying. Then there are hidden fees, queues and scams, scalping, counterfeiting, pricing wars in the resale market, and more. We can agree that it's unfair and unethical. The industry's in desperate need of more transparency and authenticity.  NFTs have the potential to change the ticketing game forever, I even bought one NFT ticket last year for a music festival. I've seen on ReelStar how artists may benefit thanks to NFTs, so NFT ticketing is just another plus for them.   NFT ticketing could provide a more flexible and customizable ticketing experience for fans. For example, event organizers could create special NFT tickets for VIP experiences or exclusive events, or allow fans to purchase collectible NFT tickets that could increase in value over time.

By hand?The main benefit of a hardware wallet is that the transaction is signed INSIDE the hardware wallet and the private keys never leave it.As soon as you send a private key to your mobile phone or computer, malware can steal it.Of course, hardware wallets can be stolen and pins (even long-ish ones) can be recovered with enough computing power (gpu clusters) and specialized tools.The most secure way would be to use a blank hardware wallet and reinitialize it each time with the seed phrase. No one can recover a seed phrase.Anyway, my main concern is the following. Hardware wallets can't connect directly to the internet and are also usually connected to software wallets such as MetaMask. They receive transactions, sign them using the private key, and return the signed transactions.The problem is that some malware is able to intercept and alter the transactions right before they reach the hardware wallet. Unless the hardware wallet shows the transaction data, including the calldata, there's no way to be sure we signed the correct transaction *before* sending it to the blockchain. Once we read it in the mempool or in a block, it's already too late!**Question:** *do you know of any hardware wallet that shows, on its own display, both the destination address and the calldata of the transactions it's about to sign?

By leveraging blockchain technology, it's possible to create decentralized gaming platforms that are free from the centralized control of big gaming companies.We can notice the beginnings of this right now, with many new projects basing the worth of their cryptocurrency and NFTs on Ethereum, while developing separate, decentralized ecosystems. This means that each of these projects will have its own independent and transparent financial system, instead of relying on the centralized one mainly controlled by the big players. If we add smart contracts that would ground the worth of people's investments in Ethereum, I believe the result would be a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem with equal opportunities for everyone - both developers and players.Some Ethereum-based projects that are going in the right direction and that may revolutionize the way we understand gaming in general (and perhaps destroy the dogma that gaming is 'a waste of time' by allowing people to build an income by playing games) are NFT City Miner,  Aavegotchi, and The Sandbox. I can't wait to see what the future brings for them, and for crypto gaming in general.Do you think decentralized Ethereum-based projects will create a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, or will they further empower the current giants of the gaming industry?",False,"Will decentralized Ethereum-based projects create a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, or will they further empower the current giants of the gaming industry?",u/[deleted],0,40,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12azht1/will_decentralized_ethereumbased_projects_create/,[]

Here is a breakdown of what you need to know:Staking rewards are considered taxable income and are taxed as ordinary income at the time of receipt. However, in the case of locked Ethereum, the time of receipt is a gray area.Regardless, it's essential to report the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of receipt, considering the continuous fluctuation of ETH's value.The moment you have dominion and control over the token, the cryptocurrency is deemed 'received.' However, since Ethereum 2.0 has been locked, it's possible to argue that you had no dominion and control over your staking rewards until they were unlocked.Reporting your rewards while they're still locked comes with several benefits. Firstly, the value of ETH could increase after the Shanghai upgrade, potentially raising the amount of taxable income you'll need to claim. Secondly, selling, converting, or disposing of your ETH creates a capital gain or loss. Holding onto the asset for more than a year qualifies as a long-term gain, which comes with more favorable tax rates.*Disclaimer: The information provided pertains to the United States.

One of the simplest methods to get these unique digital assets without having cryptocurrencies is to buy NFTs with a credit card. Some NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Nifty Gateway, let customers use credit cards to purchase nonfungible tokens. It is crucial to remember that not all marketplaces accept credit cards as a form of payment.  Users must register for an account on the marketplace they want to use to purchase NFTs with a credit card. Before customers can use a credit card to purchase nonfungible tokens on some marketplaces, identity verification is required. Users can browse the various NFTs and choose the ones they want to buy after creating and verifying their accounts.  I'm for now interested mostly in ReelStar, I'll need to check my payment options there.   Another way is using a peer-to-peer exchange which allows users to buy and sell NFTs directly with each other without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processors.

Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

Transactions in blocks have fees associated with them, called gas fees, that serve as a defense mechanism protecting blockchains from attack. &#x200B;# The Halting ProblemLet's start with an old computer science problem solved by Alan Turing himself; The Halting Problem. The Halting Problem says that the only way to find out if a program will halt execution at some point (as it should), is to execute that program. There is no way to determine if there will be a result without working to compute that result. This simple discovery is the essence for why gas exists on Ethereum.&#x200B;# Why Blockchains Have Gas FeesBlockchains must always be operational, which requires miners/validators to continuously execute transactions. These transactions are broadcast in programming languages like Solidity or the lower-level bytecode, which means that transactions are themselves programs. Validators execute transactions and compute the changes our transactions have on the network, but remember the Halting Problem here. A malicious person could send a transaction that never halts, keeps looping, and drains validator resources. Gas serves as the protection against this behavior.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/0c6qcybqd3ra1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf372764f47322fc0ade98891c0a3e5e02f794c9When we send transactions, we must associate them with gas fees we're willing to pay. This gas cost covers the resources used to compute our transaction - but is also a limit on the resources the transaction can take. If a transaction runs out of gas, execution stops and the transaction is discarded. This is far better than having transactions stuck in loops, draining resources.&#x200B;# Gas LimitGas is measured in units. Each operation that can be performed requires units of gas based on how much effort it requires. Complex transactions like deploying a smart contract or minting an NFT require more effort to compute than a simple transfer of currency. The difference of effort is measured in the different units of gas required.The units of gas used by a transaction is expressed in its gas limit. The higher the gas limit, the more effort validators can spend executing it. If a transaction requires more effort to execute than the gas allocated to it, the transaction will fail. When transactions fail due to this out of gas error, validators stop executing them and keep the gas for the effort they already spent.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/wjhul39le3ra1.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eba284cbd60ca1bba13f801cd5b529f86e2d1060The gas limit prevents blockchains from experiencing the Halting Problem. No transaction can execute indefinitely unless it also has an indefinite amount of gas associated. This in unrealistically expensive, especially since as we will see next, gas costs money.&#x200B;# Gas Pricehe cost of each unit of gas is measured in sub-units of Ethereum's currency, called gwei. The cost of a transaction is the gas limit multiplied by the gas price. Transactions can also include an additional tip to the validator, called a priority fee. You can find the gas price at a given time using [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).1 ETH splits into one billion gwei, but even with such small amounts costs can add up. The price in gwei that a transaction will require is based on current network traffic. These prices are very dynamic. When many people are performing transactions at the same time, the price of gas in gwei tends to go up. This is because blocks are limited in size to 30 million units of gas maximum, and people will outbid each other to ensure their transactions are executed.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/eqm824g6e3ra1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b3572b088b3bc22f66ccf16f4ce4728391c5e9eBlock space is limited, so the price of that space changes with how popular it is at a given point in time. This is the other side of the defense; performing an attack that spams a network to drain it of its resources (known as a DDoS attack) would increase gas prices for each subsequent transaction in that attack, making it increasingly expensive.A notably different example is Solana which has a fixed gas fee for all transactions. This has proven to not be an adequate defense, causing the chain to stop operating on many occasions.&#x200B;# Thank You!This write-up is a summary of the [full write-up](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/gas-fees-ethereums-ultimate-defense?sd=pf) from my free newsletter.

Then again, hiding in plain sight is riskier. I do understand that this risk is little to none for many of you.Most have addressed the fact that storing information in memory is a bad idea long term. Some aspect of memory always required (i.e. where is my seedphrase stored: in a safe, in the office desk etc.).

Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.&#x200B;Are there questions you'd like to see added?

In 6 months-a-year, you're going to hear non-stop about  zkEVMs. They really are the endgame for Ethereum scaling on L2 + I couldn't be more excited for this but this often leads people to believe that App Specific rollups will be left behind - this couldn't be more wrong. General Purpose L2's on Ethereum - like Optimism, Arbitrum (OP rollups), Scroll, Polygon + Taiko (zkEVMs) - are all trying to do one thing (in different ways): Basically, reproduce Ethereum, but on a faster + cheaper L2 environment, still tied to Ethereum L1 for security. If successful, this will be great for Ethereum. Ethereum, as it is today, will all move to Layer 2, and Ethereum will be a viable option to power all of crypto all in one place.  There will be no need for competing L1s aka 'ETH killers'. But what about Application Specific rollups? I think calling them all rollups confuses people, because it somewhat implies they are all trying to do the same thing. They are not - they compliment eachother, they do not compete with eachother. General Purpose rollups are trying to reproduce Ethereum on L2 - they are for devs to build apps on. App-Specific rollups are completely different - they are like complete, vertically integrated super apps/ecosystems. They are for end users to experience the power of crypto. If/when General Purpose rollups (likely zkEVMs) are successful on Ethereum L2 + bring all of Ethereum to L2. I actually envision a world where almost all of the biggest applications in the world - like the Twitters, PayPals, Ubers, etc - all become L3s on top of zkEVMs. Loopring for example, is trying to be one of these super apps - a one stop shop for all things crypto - decentralized finance (DeFi) + NFTs in one place for the end user. Finally bringing the meme of 'Being your own Bank' to reality. This could become reality on L3. If you want to build a Web3 super app, harnessing the power of crypto for the world, you will have a choice: - Build it directly on Ethereum L2 - on top of a general purpose rollup - fast + cheap option, but it won't be optimized for your specific products / applications. OR -Build a vertically integrated super app on L3 - inside your custom made rollup that can be highly optimized + customized for your specific products / applications. These rollups can submit their proofs directly to L2 instead of L1, making them even faster + cheaper. This also gives Web 2 companies a chance to come to Web3 - the next frontier. Most of Web2, if they want to compete in the future, will want to be a part of Web3, and will want an environment that is highly customizable + optimizable for their end users.This is where application-specific rollups shine. Loopring has already proven this with GameStop helping power their new thriving NFT Marketplace. I expect many more big names to follow suit into Web3 - and most won't want to build their own rollups. So in conclusion, while everyone is talking about general purpose rollups + scaling Ethereum on L2, try not to forget about Application Specific rollups - they are just getting started also I am extremely excited for the future of both. General Purpose rollups (likely zkEVMs) are going to be the endgame for Ethereum scaling through L2. They will take all of Ethereum to Layer 2 - making Ethereum THE place to be for all things crypto (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs + every other future use case) No other L1s needed. App-Specific rollups, like Loopring will likely live on L3, creating vertically integrated, end-user focused super apps. End users will eventually not even realize they are using crypto - all of this should be abstracted away.

There are a lot of people who really struggle to understand computers and I believe augmented reality will make it much easier for them to interact with computers as a whole through spatial computing. This underlying utility may pave the way for a virtual world ecosystem in which people may be able to get the same level of the sense of presence that they get in physical life in a digital space. # The transition to digital civilization It's my belief that when we are able to get the same sense of presence in a virtual space as in a physical space, we will stop building physical spaces. # The potential for crisis Every virtual world creator has the right to manage their own virtual world as they wish. However, if a virtual world becomes essential for human life, that creator may create large-scale censorship for a large part of the human population.

For most, these platforms are not essential for life or income but one day virtual worlds may become the reality most call home. * What if one day what we say could get us banned from what most people consider reality? # The context for my questionI'd like to come up with a charter of rights and freedoms for the Metaverse and I would love your input. The key problem at hand is how we balance the rights of a virtual world creator to the rights of those who inhabit virtual worlds. There's an inherent tension between protecting the rights that a creator has over the world that they create versus the rights of individual users. ## Progress so far**Right to obscurity*** The right not to be individually penalized for non-criminal acts done outside of a particular virtual world.**Right to migration*** The right to switch from virtual world to virtual world without contractual hindrance.**Right of privacy**1. The right not to be tracked in a persistent, identifiable fashion, without expressed, written, and updated consent.2. The right to separately agree to the tracking of political or religious beliefs.3. The right to take down, or disassociate from, content published by oneself.## Breaking down the progress**Right to obscurity**Obscurity is all about making sure a global reputation system for the Metaverse is never created. I believe a global reputation system that's interoperable between worlds has the ability to create global censorship and therefore each virtual world should judge its members by their behavior within that world. If not, a single mistake, in the limited interpretation of what a mistake could be by one world, may cause us problems for the rest of our life. **Right to migration**As long as we can use viable alternatives to a virtual world, we are never locked out of the Metaverse as a whole. The big problem here is that the network effect may make those alternatives unviable just as competing with YouTube is almost totally unviable because of Youtube's massive viewer base. **Right of privacy**This is all about that extra layer of protection so that you can't be identified as belonging to a particular community as that identification process is the first step to maltreatment. # Ok, my question for real this time**How do we ensure that individual rights are fully protected even as we transition from the physical to the digital?**How do we avoid the network effect, (people wanting to be where the other people are) along with the enormous complexity of virtual worlds laying the foundation for a new reality that resembles the lack of rights and freedoms we see from today's social media giants? Let's say that we create a right to interoperability, such a right creates a financial obligation on the creator of a virtual world, something which will stifle innovation potentially. Moreover, interoperability isn't practical on so many levels when it comes to complex technology. Migration, sure but if one virtual world has the people it's not like those people can just walk into another virtual world -- keep in mind that virtual world creators size all of their doors to all of the items that you could wear in a potential virtual world.

For some applications, these properties can prove very valuable. Here they are spelled out:* Protocol adherence: The guarantee that a software system is following a given protocol.* Censorship resistance: The guarantee that users can properly interact with a software system.* Persistence: The guarantee that a software system will continue running far into the future.Those main seem intriguing, but what contributes to a digital substrates ability to guarantee them? The contributions mainly comes from two characteristics:1. Trustlessness: The minimization of trust required from the human operators of a digital substrate for a given PCP property to be upheld.2. Resiliency: The maximization of resiliency of a digital substrate to defend a given PCP property against attack from a third party.With those terms out of the way, we can dig into an analysis of the two main digital substrates for running software: servers, and blockchains. Let's take a look at each of them in turn to better understand how they compare in their PCP guarantees.## ServersAt a high level, a server is a single computer running software that people can interact with over the internet. Servers are what the internet is built on today. That being said, they don't offer the strongest PCP guarantees:1. Trustlessness: it's necessary to trust that the operator of a server will uphold protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence. At any moment the operator of a server could modify its behavior to breach its protocol, censor certain users, or terminate.2. Resiliency: a software deployment is only as resilient as the operator of the server. At any moment they could get coerced by a third party into modifying the server's behavior to breach the protocol, censor certain users, or terminate. Alternatively, it only takes a single hack to take control of the server, and a single explosive to destroy it.Now that we've seen what servers are capable of, let's see how blockchains compare.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/nb3c6csu4kpa1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=10b8694cbe0b926a4b34d8dfe1b034074a03a237## BlockchainsAt a high level, a blockchain is a network of servers that redundantly execute the same software and reach consensus on its status through a system of checks and balances. Part of its power lies in its inclusivity - anyone can contribute to the network by running a node without needing to ask anyone for permission. The idea of blockchain is to be *the* digital substrate which *best maximizes* PCP guarantees:1. Trustlessness: Let's break down this analysis into each of protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence.   1. Protocol adherence: every user has the ability to verify whether or not a blockchain is following a given protocol, so there's no need to trust the operators of the blockchain to uphold protocol adherence.   2. Censorship resistance: as long as at least a few percent of the servers which make up a blockchain don't try to censor a given transaction, it will not be censored. Coupling this with the fact that anyone can contribute to the operation of a blockchain by permissionlessly running a node, we find that blockchains are highly censorship resistant without needing to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold censorship resistance.   3. Persistence: anybody can contribute to the operation of a blockchain, so there's no need to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold persistence.2. Resiliency: following from the trustlessness properties, there is no centralized point of failure that a third party can coerce, hack, or destroy to induce a blockchain to break from protocol adherence, censorship resistance, or persistence. Instead, the third party will need to coerce the users themselves to not interact with a given blockchain. This is much more difficult. # So What? When Does It Make Sense To Use a Blockchain?Deciding between running software on a server or a blockchain comes down to a cost benefit analysis. The main advantage of using blockchain is its PCP guarantees, while its limitations include slower performance and weaker privacy capabilities (although these limitations are being eroded over time). In which applications are PCP guarantees actually valuable?For many applications, using a server is the better option. PCP guarantees are mainly important in cases where a significant conflict of interest appears between the operators of software and its users (trustlessness solves this), or when there are concerns of a third party interfering with software (resiliency solves this).Today, conflicts of interests are typically solved via government regulation. In fintech apps for example, rather than trusting software operators to uphold PCP, you rely on a government to ensure that the software operators adequately follow PCP.As far as concerns of a third party interfering with software goes, today, applications solve this by relying on a government to defend servers and punish those who try to interfere.So what's left? What types of applications does it make sense to deploy on a blockchain? We'll answer this question in a future post.

I'm kind of arriving on a realization that there's so much potential in the already-deployed, but over an unnecessarily diffuse landscape. a good demonstration of this to me has been the plethora of different talks from ETHDenver. more specifically, just look at all of the discussion and deployment around EIP-4337. tbh, there may be more of an opportunity to debate the finer details like the bundlers and the authentication methods than there is to eliminate the massive ecosystem cost of phishing links and lost seedphrases.there's also very fundamental communities in Ethereum, like gitcoin and scaffoldeth, where the public good can be consumed at scale but the core maintenance and composition of those is not proportionate (though arguably substantial). I'm not really discussing a problem, it's more of an subnominal opportunity. likewise, I'm not saying people aren't aware, it's more of a dilemma where the attention spans aren't overlapping on whatever public space we cover, and we're spending excessive capital 'treating the symptoms instead of curing the disease'.there's also the unspoken capture of zero-sum capital by inefficent mechanisms. for example, if every project  airdrop'd tokens/allowlists/access to recipients on the basis that they wholesale 'like/retweet/tag/comment', the outcome of that spent social capital is a network that echoes to itself. same for a lot of DAOs (plutocratic ones especially), if there's a sociopolitical whip to attend the same meetings, ratify the same proposals, agree on the same adversarial rules, burn the same gas, gaslight in the same manner, then we're spending extra on bargaining costs with less compatible communities, and getting more capitalized to become a monoculture. and we're losing the small fish along the way.there's parts of ethereum that do really well in these environments. MEV is actually working out really well when you look at it as a compositional problem. DeFi protocols innovate the classes of operation, liquidity, and hypothecation. node operators innovate on the other side, and in between there are a bunch of grayhats arbing the difference and forcing adaptation. crypto social media is really entertaining, there are maximalists and NFTers and other tings. there are new social protocols that run on their own rollup, or a sidechain, or even another network altogether. entire EVM sidechains & rollups are manifesting with modularity, DeFi consensus, you name it. airdrops & farmers continue to provide us a case study of sybil resistance in practice.but I still get this feeling that its too diffuse, and we've reached this stage where the aggregate sociocultural downside is growing faster than we're optimizing & accelerating critical, introspective development. personally, I'm totally fine with how the protocol is developing & scaling, and the applications on top are fun, if nothing else. the succinct cryptography is fascinating and the privacy innovations are inspring. however, there's too much opportunity & stakes on the table to ignore.this is what I'm proposing: there needs to be a stack of the 'fat protocol' vibe and 'social architecture' without any contrived, pyramid-scheme, ponzinomic, or walled-garden nonsense. git is crazy scalable software because it is so undefined. ethereum already has crazy scalable n-tiered architecture (like Default, Pipeline, and Diamonds). hypercertificates are already crazy scalable forms of fungible, verifiable credentials. I think there's a supercritical, supermodular application that inherits the social tech from teams like Lens, Orbis, Farcaster, the compositional tech from Scaffold, Gnosis, Gelato, Uniswap, Wagmi, & OS tools like Alpaca, Langchain, Forge, Arweave, ethOS, and others. there should be an OS-agnostic, token-agnostic open forum & groupchat platform with extendable, modular abilities like signing multisig transactions, deploying AMOs on other chains, deploying software, funding public goods, etc.in other words, I'm just saying (and experimenting) that the focus should be centralized on the core thesis: ethereum can be an internet-tier technology tree at a time when the world needs such a technology tree. it's kind of a farce whenever there's a random DAO committing death-by-committee/death-by-slushfund, whenever there's a seedphrase watering-hole scam on Twitter/Discord, or just the broader 'monkey jpeg'/ '$$$ hack'/'VC dump to community' image the public consumes. so let's just focus on the supercritical root application of that tech tree.",False,Centralization Possibilities,u/[deleted],0,6,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11yvmac/centralization_possibilities/,[]

And with Ethereum being the most popular blockchain platforms, we can expect a versatile and robust infrastructure for building smart contracts.After looking into some of the major industries in the crypto space, here are 4 common use cases I've come across in regards to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: the use of smart contracts here help facilitate transactions like lending, trading and borrowing which in turn helps in democratizing finance, making it more accessible to all, and reducing the need for middle men.For example, Uniswap is one such DeFi platform that uses smart contracts to exchange tokens without the need a centralized matching engine.* **Supply Chain Management**:  smart contracts help to automate supply chain processes in a number of different ways- from verifying product authenticity to managing inventory and payments which in turn leads to increasing transparency, real-time data, reducing costs, and preventing fraud.For example, Morpheus Network automates the flow of information and goods between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and end customers through smart contracts executed on the Ethereum blockchain.* **Real Estate**: smart contracts enable tokenization of real estate, fractional ownership and help with streamlining transactions. This can help increase liquidity, reduce costs, and also make it easier for all to access real estate investments.For example, Propy uses smart contracts in order to automate and secure the various stages of a real estate transaction which also acts as a digital escrow service.* **Gaming**: Smart contracts enable true ownership of in-game assets, create decentralized gameplays, and facilitate peer-to-peer gaming experiences.For example, Decentraland makes use of smart contracts which allows gamers to buy and sell virtual real estate and in-game assets in a transparent and secure way.I also came across the use of smart contracts in **identity verification**, but a **couple of questions** I have in relation to this are along the lines of how can cases wherein we see discrepancies in the information provided by users are handled? And also whether smart contracts can be audited to ensure its accuracy and efficiency?   It would be great if someone could help me understand this better.Have you come across some other common use case for smart contacts on the Ethereum blockchain? Would love to hear more about that.

The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet.

They are extensions of Ethereum where people can perform transactions while paying less fees. Here's a useful way to imagine this: Ethereum is a road with tollbooths, and the traffic can be very slow. The more traffic there is, the more expensive each toll is. Layer 2's are super-highways that are in parallel to the main road, allowing anyone to move back and forth between them.Just like a car can either be on the main road or the super-highway, if a wallet has a balance on Ethereum, it can move that balance to instead be held on a Layer 2. From there, that ETH can be spent on NFTs or used in DeFi platforms, or eventually moved back to Layer 1. The fees on Layer 2's are much cheaper than on Ethereum, so interacting with applications there can be much more cost-effective.Layer 2's generally only exist on Ethereum. Ethereum is one of the most expensive blockchains to transact on, having strived towards being secure and decentralized ahead of being cheap to use. Layer 2's make it cheaper to transact in a broader Ethereum ecosystem, while alternate Layer 1's exist that compete with Ethereum instead. These will often be immediately cheap to use due to either low traffic or greater centralization, so no Layer 2's exist for other blockchains yet.'*&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/b4sn0akq8boa1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=819d4bfccb19fc2ebe11368b7153315713f0d262&#x200B;# Sidechains vs RollupsThere are two main types of Layer 2, sidechains and rollups, and the differences between them are important to understand.A sidechain is an entire blockchain that runs in parallel to Ethereum and reports its status to the Layer 1. While connected to Ethereum through these status reports, sidechains are still separate blockchains. This means having a separate consensus model and set of validators. Sidechains require more than half of validators to agree on every block, and there are often very few validators to keep the network quick.Rollups, on the other hand, are not blockchains. They are off-chain networks where people can perform transactions, and those transactions are bundled together (or rolled up) and posted to Ethereum as one. Rollups use sequencers to bundle transactions together, which are still centralized technologies (although some are working to create decentralized sequencers).&#x200B;# Optimistic and Zero Knowledge RollupsRollups are a type of Layer 2 that bundles transactions and posts them together to Ethereum. There are two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge, also with important differences.Optimistic rollups don't need validators, but instead make available the data they sequence to be verified and challenged by anyone, for a certain period of time. If anyone discovers a dishonest transaction during that time, they can immediately prove its dishonesty using cryptography. As a result, only one honest verifier is required to keep optimistic rollups secure (as in, every other verifier could be dishonest and it wouldn't matter).Zero Knowledge rollups, on the other hand, don't need validators nor verifiers, instead using cryptography to prove the validity of every batch of transactions as it happens. Since every batch has an automatic proof of its own validity, no additional consensus or verification on transactions is necessary. While this is more secure, it is also more data intensive.&#x200B;[Source: msfew.eth](https://preview.redd.it/gku36rog9boa1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b587169887b9ccddb0ee4194f2674e1f95158c61)Currently, only optimistic rollups can be EVM-equivalent.'* Zero knowledge rollups can't perform the same complex transactions, since complexity makes generating those proofs more difficult. As a result, optimistic rollups seem to be better for elaborate applications, whereas zero knowledge rollups can be better for processing many simple transactions.'*The challenges towards creating EVM-equivalent zero knowledge rollups are significant, but there are companies working on these challenges and this could change in the future.&#x200B;# Why We Need RollupsRollups make fewer compromises to achieve scalability compared to sidechains. Only one honest verifier is required to keep an optimistic rollup secure; every other verifier could be dishonest and it wouldn't matter. Optimistic rollups need 1/n honest verifiers, and anyone can become a verifier, but sidechains need 1/2 honest validators, and not anyone can become a validator.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/mq3vhv9u9boa1.jpg?width=636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02bc9a52440196867d7f65f2bc99bb8e4cad86cfZero knowledge rollups don't even need verifiers, but their applications are limited, at least currently. Rollups are centralized as far as their sequencers go, but decentralized alternatives may emerge. Rollups can become fully decentralized, whereas sidechains cannot. Further, assets are retrievable from rollups even if the companies behind them stop operating. The same is not true for sidechains, where assets are irretrievable if the sidechain stops operating.Rollups are the best type of Layer 2 we have, and are seeing increasing prominence in Ethereum development. EIPs and upgrades are increasingly trying to make rollups even cheaper to use, in an effort to increase their capacity even more. In recent years, Ethereum has even moved to a rollup-centric roadmap.If an upgrade can make Layer 1 costs 10x cheaper, that could lead to 100x or even 1000x cost savings on rollups, or a capacity to handle that many more transactions. It therefore makes sense that rollups will facilitate an increasing share of Ethereum transactions.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/0wfxt3uz9boa1.jpg?width=521&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd86d77b0d9eba518ac7af1565317184e4ba50df&#x200B;# Layer 2's TodayRelatively speaking, sidechains are the easiest type of Layer 2 to deploy, and one that gives it's creators notable control. The Polygon Foundation was able to [increase gas fees](https://thedefiant.io/polygon-transaction-fee-hike) at a moment's notice to combat what they perceived to be on-chain spam. This centralized control also lead to the $622 million [hack of the Axie sidechain](https://decrypt.co/96322/hacker-622-million-axie-infinity-ronin-ethereum). Both a blessing and a curse, it is likely more sidechains will exist in the future. Their relative ease to develop is likely why we've seen sidechains emerge ahead of rollups.Optimism and Arbitrum publicly launched in 2021 and together have grown to hold over $5.5 billion in assets, as of today. Both are optimistic rollups and with many applications on them. Currently only Artbitrum, the larger of the two, is EVM-equivalent. While Optimism can execute most transactions the same way Ethereum would, but not all. Both networks require ETH to pay for gas. Companies including Starkware (previously Cairo) and Loopring are developing Zero-Knowledge rollups, with versions already live to the public, but limited in the types of transactions they can handle. The term zkEVM has been a buzzword recently as Zero Knowledge rollups continue trying to become EVM-equivalent, but it is not clear if this is possible. &#x200B;# In Conclusion&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/zuwwzq4iaboa1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e82ad015c4feee4fb5097fd4ff2ff0ed80055d2Naturally, Ethereum is limited.

Instead, to allow more people to access the benefits of blockchain, we must expand the space we already have. This is what Layer 2's accomplish.

[Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/)) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of **self-custody** - namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all - without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.A close cousin of multisig wallets is [social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), where a single key can be used to sign transactions but if that key is lost, a group of keys held by other people can be used to recover the funds. Social recovery wallets are much easier than multisig wallets to use, especially with the rise of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) account abstraction and upcoming wallets like [Soul Wallet](https://twitter.com/zengjiajun_eth/status/1636496326723768320) that will make the technology user-friendly. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations's savings.Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on a concept of **guardians**: a set of N addresses, typically held by other people, of which any M can approve an operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians must sign a message to reset the key.**Two key questions in using multisig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?** This post will outline how I think about this issue. The ideas here should mostly apply equally to multisig and social recovery wallets being used to secure funds for individuals and for organizations.### What do we want out of guardians?* Minimize the chance that they lose their keys* Minimize the chance that they collude to steal your money, or get coerced into doing so* To the extent that the above two risks are unavoidable, the risk of each guardian should be maximally _uncorrelated_ - you want to minimize commonalities that risk situations that will disable or compromise too many of your guardians at the same time.This answer is simple and short, but it guides all of the choices that I make with regard to guardians.### It's okay for some of the guardians to be your own devices, but not too manyIt makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices - it doesn't reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it _is_ your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you're also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.My rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, **you should control at least 1 guardian, and at most N-M guardians**. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).### Choose guardians who do not often talk to each other or ideally do not know each otherIdeally, the guardians should not know who each other are. This greatly reduces the risk that they collude, and furthermore there is _no good reason_ for them to know each other. If something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people's minds in such a situation (eg. contact your family).Also, you want to **minimize correlations between your guardians as much as possible**: don't choose two guardians who live in the same city (or ideally even the same country), or two guardians who use the same type of wallet, and have a balance between different operating systems.### Guardians should ask a security question before approving an operationWhen you ask a guardian to approve an operation for you (in a multisig, this would be any transaction, and in a social recovery wallet, this would be resetting your account's key), they should not simply say yes immediately. This would be a disaster for security: if someone hacks into your chat account, they could scan your messages, figure out who your guardians are, contact each of them and ask them to confirm, and thereby steal your funds.My preferred protocol to avoid this is to instruct guardians to **ask a security question**. That is, when you ask for a confirmation on your operation, the guardian should ask you something that only the two of you and very few other people know (eg. 'the last time we met, what kind of food did we have?'), and only confirm the operation if you give the correct answer. A natural alternative is voice or video calls, but in the age of AI deepfakes this is weaker evidence than before, and so you may want to combine the voice/video call with asking some kind of security question.### If you're doing 'degen' stuff, make sure to have guardians who can respond quickly. Otherwise, this doesn't matterIf you're doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice (and therefore also, guardians in different time zones, so enough guardians to complete a transaction are awake at all times) to protect your funds. If you do not do these kinds of things, however, then speed is not particularly important, and in fact may even be slightly harmful, because convincing people of the need to act urgently is a common social engineering tactic used by hackers and it can be good to have people who are by default mentally averse to that.### Test each guardian at least once a yearMake a test operation at least once a year. Ideally, make two test operations each year, using half your guardians for one and the other half of your guardians for the other. This makes sure that your guardians haven't forgotten or lost their accounts.### Advanced: privacyOne of the challenges with guardians today is that the tech does not yet exist to make it possible to protect your financial privacy from your guardians. However, this is a technical problem that can be solved technically: instead of guarding your account directly, the guardians guard a 'lockbox' contract where the link between your account and the lockbox is hidden. Making the link stay hidden until a recovery needs to be made is pretty easy: for example, your account could have as a guardian a CREATE2 contract that only the lockbox can create. Making the link stay hidden _even after_ a recovery, however, requires more advanced ZK-SNARK tech. Hence, this is a problem that I expect will slowly be solved over the next few years.",False,How I think about choosing guardians for multisig and social recovery wallets,u/[deleted],4,316,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11tijiv/how_i_think_about_choosing_guardians_for_multisig/,[]

Somehow accidentally deleted it.Over the past I've come across multiple instances in the news, where motivated actors (govt, media, etc.) act against privacy tools and also privacy coins etc. You can find plenty of examples online on that - and there are even gag letters, which companies get where they are forced to implement certain backdoors into their cloud services and they're not allowed to tell anyone about it.And that's only the stuff we know about.With this agenda, privacy coins/tools like Monero, Tornado Cash, etc. ars also targeted. I won't discuss the relationship to money laundering now. But the point is, that these actors have lots of incentives to discourage widespread usage of these things. The popularity of bitcoin and ethereum is likely not too strongly attacked, because the Blockchains are completely public and it's easy for existing large scale data globbling systems to connect people via their KYC at exchanges to their wallet addresses.My hypothesis is, that when ethereum eventually moves to a privacy-by-default stealth address-based system, these actors will use lots of power and techniques to avoid this from happening. They could use all kinds of nice and not-so-nice techniques and for instance keep the ethereum foundation from actually working on this. As the saying goes (afaik). The bear won't attack you, as long as you don't attack/threaten it's power. The ethereum foundation would probably have been much more in cross-fire if ethereum had been privacy-first since the beginning.My worry is, that our goals of privacy in the future could get sabotaged/stopped - leaving us with an incomplete Blockchain and unfulfilled vision.Yes, there will be still privacy L2s and smart contracts.

(**IdenaAnnouncement**) The group didn't look suspicious, and it even had a history of previous news from the project. I assumed that it was a real announcement channel (**IdenaAnnouncements**), but I failed to notice that it was actually a group and not a channel. The scammers had put restrictions on every member so that they couldn't write anything. As you can see the difference in names between the fake one and the real one is only in one letter '`s'`.I followed the link, and the website looked quite professional. However, it requested access to my MetaMask wallet. Since I didn't have much money in it, I assumed that the official channel couldn't do any scam. I had been in this project for years. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a contract that took all of my money (about $47).Here are some key takeaways from my experience that might help others avoid getting scammed:1. Adjust your privacy settings to prevent anyone from adding you to groups without your consent.2. Scammers are increasingly personalizing their attacks, parsing group members and imposing restrictions on them individually.3. They also create fake members to make the group appear genuine and lure people into clicking on links.4. The name of the fake group might be very similar to the original one, with just a small difference in spelling.5. Always check is it a group with restrictions or is it a channel?I realize now that I made a mistake, but scammers are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. It's important to be cautious and vigilant to protect ourselves from their schemes.I hope that my message helped people avoid being potentially scammed.**The scammers addresses:***0xD53f5c2cA654F291a44E611e17F42347660Faf66**0x51cbfc2770c3835eda70e883898c013fa5b2a08e***The scammers website:**meta-multichain.tech",False,"I was scammed because the scam didn't look like a scam. ‚úß Besides my own foolishness, scammers are becoming smarter.",u/[deleted],1,227,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11rnz81/i_was_scammed_because_the_scam_didnt_look_like_a/,[]

The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups.

This is bad, and you should feel bad. Let's use Rai more, and here's a way to do it.# USDC is a crutchRecent events with Dai and USDC prove yet again why stablecoins backed by USD are toxic assets. The reality, [as Arthur Hayes put it](https://youtu.be/vSvVkm7gViE?t=2518), is that DeFi will always be hamstrung if we depend on US dollar stability. It introduces centralization risks, and also draws the ire of regulators who want bond stability. When you realize all liquid stablecoins are backed mostly by US treasury bonds, guarded by centralized commercial banks, you realize just how this house of cards can fall. When certain market conditions are met, the bonds are liquidated at market rates, where you may receive $0.94 on every dollar.**Oh wait, that's what just happened**You can do research on bond mechanics and how the combination of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank destroyed the value of USDC, but look no further than the PSM on Dai to see how destructive this crutch is. [It currently stands at 63% USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) as everyone panic sold USDC for Dai to get out of fears that Circle was undercollateralized, [which it turns out they are](https://www.circle.com/blog/an-update-on-usdc-and-silicon-valley-bank). # Stop using USDC challengeNow here's the hard part. I know you want to larp as a decentralization maxi, but it's time to stop it and actually be a decentralization maxi. Here's how you can do it.## As a userAs a user, how can you promote Rai? By actually using Rai. Instead of going to conferences and larping about how great ETH is, but then splitting bills with Venmo, why don't use use Rai?- Buy some Rai- Use it to split bills with other DeFi native people.I understand risks that it could go down, so just use Rai in a small fashion just to get used to it. You don't need to go crazy and buy $100K in Rai, but keep a small amount on a layer 2 and slosh it around.## As a DeFi trader.Big bag boys, have I got news for you. Rai is currently paying you to generate it. As it stands, it has [over 4% APY](https://stats.reflexer.finance/) to mint new RAI. How does it work? [The stability peg is currently negative](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd).- Make a Reflexer Safe and generate Rai. Long ETH using Reflexer bonds.- Take the Rai and market make with it. Preferably on L2s.Now here's the interesting part? Want leverage? Use DeFi Saver to mint new RAI and rebuy ETH. [You can do this in 1 swap and have some good capital efficiency](https://app.defisaver.com/reflexer/manage).## As a Project OwnerThis is an interesting part. You're a project owner, so you have sweet yield farming rewards for people who want to use your project. I want to ask, why are you using anything else but Rai as the base token in your project? Why are you doing ICOs with USDC? Why is your NFT project selling in Dai/USDC and not even giving the option for Rai? Rai is right there. Use it. Help bootstrap Rai liquidity. Why should you do this you ask? Well even if you complain about the possibility of Rai going down in value, considering this weekend USDC dropped to $0.88, you clearly do not have the safety you think you have. You have just as much volatility risk as Rai already, except you also have the trust risk where you hope to god Circle or the Bitfinex Cartel actually has the bonds they say they do. You are effectively ignoring your risks, while Rai's risks are right in front of you and clear. You're just risking your project, and may wake up one day with $0.50 on every USDC. Here's an idea:- Stop doing token raises with USDC. Use Rai.- Generate yield farm liquidity with Rai. Preferably run your yield farm programs on L2s so general users can access Rai.- Promote Rai. Use Rai as payment tokens for your merch. Support Rai in your app as a base token. Use Rai as a payment for conferences. Enjoy Rai within your organization and offer it as salaries.# FinIf you've made it this far, I hope you're now thinking. You're all far too deep into USD stablecoins, and you don't realize you are not supporting decentralized finance. Every USD has a link to a commercial US bank, regulated by the government, and will always be crutched by regulators who manage bond volatility. The next few weeks, you will see people use the recent bank failures as an excuse to regulate these tokens further, as they are directly linked to US treasuries markets. This is foolish. Simplify your risks. Rai is risky, but it's simplified risks backed by pure ETH.**We need you to help promote Rai**The hard part? You're not going to get rich doing it. It's not like promoting your digital beanie babies or new yield farm. It won't make you a token billionaire. No one is making a yield farm strategy for Rai, because it's already mostly crystalized. The project owners aren't going to get rich from it, and neither will you. It's an already deployed token, that has been in the wild for over a year, that's just sitting there waiting for you to realize it's use. Use it.# A note from SatoshiThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.

This is not surprising, considering the numerous benefits that the Ethereum blockchain offers over others imo. Some of the key benefits of the Ethereum blockchain include:* **Smart contract functionality**: Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to introduce smart contracts which allows for the automation of complex business and financial processes without the need for intermediaries. * **Developer community**: Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities which has resulted in the creation of a number of libraries, tools and frameworks making it easier for gaming developers to build here. * **Flexibility**: Ethereum is a highly flexible platform which allows the creation of a wide range of dApps going beyond financial applications and towards the gaming sector too, making it more ideal.  * **Interoperability**: Ethereum's compatibility with other blockchains through its use of smart contract programming languages like Vyper allows for the construction of decentralized applications (including games) that can interact with multiple blockchain networks. Some examples of popular games built on Ethereum blockchain include:  1) **Axie Infinity**'- a popular game that allows players to collect, breed, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies.  2) **Gods Unchained**'-  a digital trading card game that allows players to collect and battle with unique cards.  3) **Vulcan Verse**'- an open world blockchain game built by Vulcan Forged where you can travel around and interact with games and events.   4) **The Sandbox**'- a virtual world that allows players to buy and sell virtual land and assets.Overall, in addition to the above-mentioned features, its decentralization, transparency and security make it an idea platform for building games involving digital assets and its benefits are clear.

We've recently launched our website and our first game is now available to play!Our goal is to create a platform where multiple games can be played, and users on the platform can earn governance tokens for engaging. With these tokens, users can create proposals or vote on created proposals to steer the direction of the platform. This includes gameplay balancing, development of new games, steering of the community treasury, and layer 2 solutions.Our first game revolves around the care and growth of 'Charlys,' which are dynamic NFTs used as the basis for characters. Players can clean, feed, and play a mini-game in Unity with their minted characters, and with enough care, players can evolve their characters, enhancing their attributes and changing their visual appearance. We're currently working on a battle game where users can compete with their evolved characters against each other and AI.To kickstart our decentralization process, we'll be launching an Airdrop Campaign soon. We believe the only way to achieve true decentralization is to distribute tokens fairly and get as many people as possible to participate.

I'm fairly new, so please understand,if my question is already resolved/easy to answer.WalletConnect is the most widely used standard for dapps and wallets to be agnostic to the concrete counterparty they are connecting to. I was asking myself, how resillient this setup is.For instance, if a dapp's UI is hosted on ipfs and it connects via metamask, then that connection is directly via the browser and local (afaik), and it cannot be intercepted (assuming browser not hacked etc.).However, with WalletConnect there are relays running on wallet-connects servers which make this concrete connection between the dapp and the wallet. This is a centralised security/censorship issue. [As far as I can see, it's not possible to host these relays yourself at the moment.](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/faq). I also don't know the specifics of WalletConnect relays. What is the worst thing that can happen, if they become compromised? Can compromised servers deny people using a dapp? Can compromised servers make nasty things via mitm attacks?I am aware, that the direct interaction with the smart contract can happen without the UI. But I don't think that the majority of users in crypto can actually do that when in emergency.Given the value of decentralisation and Trustlessness, I am not sure, whether the widespread of WalletConnect relays is really all that ok. After all, if a powerful actor wants, they might approach the WalletConnect and force them to change their servers to do a specific thing.It would be great, if this couldn't be used for censorship just like the tornado cash was blacklisted.What do you think?

She was one of the founders of the first easy to use Ethereum wallet (My Ether Wallet), before which we had to wait to sync the chain before making transactions (was that Parity, Myst, ?, I don't remember). This was an absolute game changer and allowed many more people to start accessing Ethereum... just in time for them to faced with a barrage of new 'Initial Coin Offerings', investments with varying degrees of legitimacy. As well as being partially responsible for enabling the chaos that ensued, Taylor also took it upon herself to try and call out scams and terrible investment 'opportunities' that newbies were falling for.

This was what sparked the conversations around soul-bound tokens and their uses in the middle of last year, it also talks about the state and future of many aspects of the space that are key to governance, such as Sybil resistance, quadratic funding and social recovery wallets, all of which are becoming increasingly important in DAOs and Web 3.0 in general. * https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763She is a big picture / long game thinker for what the crypto ecosystem could become, if we can navigate our way there without falling into corporate/governmental control on one side of the ridge or fraudsters and scams on the other.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

To keep this validator set healthy, it should be protected from any drastic changes in number for security. If the number of validators could increase or decrease very quickly, this could be employed as a tactic in orchestrating an attack. https://preview.redd.it/8td8awbkrjla1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1b4adf7facc14aa97c8db216953459814fd2e8fA party could potentially exit a large number of validators, immediately causing a scare and others to exit, then instantly activate twice the amount of validators and gain significant control over the network. If there were no buffers to exit and entry, this could be a serious vulnerability to Ethereum. Beyond the queues, there are additional penalties to those that perform a malicious action (like proposing two different blocks at once) and are slashed.&#x200B;# Unstaking on EthereumThe Shanghai hard fork introduces withdrawals for which information is written into a new space on Ethereum blocks, without the need to pay for gas. There are two queues withdrawers must go through to withdraw their ETH. The first is the exit queue and is somewhat slow, the other is the withdrawal queue and is much faster.https://preview.redd.it/bxr5idw2sjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4624231b38e2d29bd543abe7b32815ccbaffa6d4The slower exit queue is only necessary to enter if a validator is trying to withdraw all of their staked ETH (the principal + rewards), in which case it's called a full withdrawal. The exit queue allows 7-8 full withdrawals to happen every 32 blocks. The number of withdrawals permitted in such a period is called the churn limit, and increases as more validators become active. Once a validator intending a full withdrawal goes through this exit queue, they'll arrive in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators (approximately 1/5th of the current set) 63 days to go through the exit queue.The faster withdrawal queue processes a maximum of 16 full or partial withdrawals every block (or every 12 seconds). A partial withdrawal happens automatically and disburses rewards earned by validators to addresses they designate to receive those rewards. Both of these are viewed as being equal in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators 20 hours to go through the withdrawal queue.There is a prerequisite to entering either of the queues above: validators must ensure that withdrawal addresses are updated and refer to valid addresses on Ethereum (technically, in the 0x01 format). This can be done now, and doing so will place rewards for those validators in the withdawal queue automatically once Shanghai goes live.&#x200B;# Impacts of UnstakingWhile likely that many will want to unstake their ETH initially, the capacity for validators to withdraw is throttled. The reason is so that the validator set doesn't change too drastically in too short a time. For the same reason, a queue exists to begin staking ETH. This also impacts the price of ETH, which won't see the supply dump many prophesize.https://preview.redd.it/7bis8l4trjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfa6319f9584eef98ba10a014ae0f18ef987ebb7It is likely that even amongst those who unstake, a significant portion will start staking again shortly thereafter. This is because many will be shifting from one staking service to another, something they can't do until they unstake first. A further incentive is in the rewards rate, which increases as the validator set gets smaller.Finally, the automatic disbursement of rewards will be exciting to look forward to. It introduces new liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem directly, as opposed to having it locked up with the ETH that's being staked. Ever since the Merge happened, validators have not received their rewards for validating the blockchain, the rewards are locked with the staked ETH. The additional '~0.2 ETH per block added directly into the ecosystem should have some interesting effects.# In ConclusionIt's fascinating that staking withdrawals are right around the corner. The conversation around whether to include withdrawals in the Shanghai hard fork was a big reason this newsletter started. It seemed necessary that as many of us in Ethereum as possible be knowledgeable about upcoming upgrades so that we can lend our support to the ones we consider most important.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/2asqa9xlrjla1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=abd7fa1e14d1b6b4d16eea2527263fe5424fc2bd&#x200B;This is a summary of the full write-up available on my free newsletter!

The company does not send the items, the user can request the 80$ back through the smart contract;2. The company sends the items, the user confirms the items when he receives them, all is well;3. The company sends the items, they are defective, the user does not confirm the items and requests the 80$ back through the smart contract;4. The user does not pay 90$ but only 80$ (doesn't use MetaMask, manually buy the items); the order would be registered in the smart contract, but the company sees that the user has not paid the correct amount for the shipping costs and decides to not send the item (obviously it would also notify the user for that). The user can still request its 80$ back through the smart contract.So worst case scenario the user would lose the shipping costs, granted I don't add another mechanic so that the user can ask a refund on that cost as well, and then the company will then have the right to accept such refund case by case.It seems to me this approach kinda tries to minimize the risks for both actors, but I want to know your opinion on it.

Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

New Jersey is considering a bill that could make it illegal to sell NFTs without a license. The Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act proposes to prohibit engaging in digital asset business activities without being licensed by the department. This means that artists who simply want to sell a piece of art as an NFT will need a license.While this legislation might seem like it only affects residents of New Jersey, it could have wider implications. Selling NFTs has become increasingly popular, with many artists and creators using them as a way to monetize their work. If this bill passes, it could set a precedent for other states or even countries to introduce similar legislation.The bill not only requires a license for holding, storing, or maintaining custody of a digital asset on behalf of others but also for issuing a digital asset, such as creating a smart contract that sells an NFT. This means that anyone who wants to sell NFTs, even as a hobby or a one-time thing, would need to go through the licensing process.The repercussions of this legislation are far-reaching. Not only would it be impractical and unreasonable for artists to have to go to a dingy office in North Jersey to fill out paperwork and receive a certificate just to sell an NFT, but violators would also face a hefty fee.The proposed legislation has sparked controversy and criticism, with many people expressing concerns about the impact it could have on the NFT market. It also brings up questions about how much regulation is necessary in the world of digital assets and whether this bill is a step too far.In the words of Twitter user Degen Doobz, 'remember the saying, 'first they came for the New Jersey Pepe derivative NFTs, and I did not speak out because I was not from NJ. Then they came for my Pepe derivative NFTs, and there was no one left to speak for me.' This legislation will have repercussions for everyone.'It remains to be seen whether this bill will pass and what the future holds for the NFT market. However, it is clear that the digital world is evolving rapidly, and it is up to lawmakers to find a balance between regulation and innovation.If you wanna learn more I post a free weekly newsletter here: [https://poetryofprogress.substack.com/](https://poetryofprogress.substack.com/)",False,üö®BREAKING: New law makes it ILLEGAL to hold NFTs (not a joke),u/[deleted],0,0,0.39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11d2y8j/breaking_new_law_makes_it_illegal_to_hold_nfts/,[]

I have done a lot of reading but still find myself scratching my head around the intricacies of censorship as it pertains MEV.My understanding is that ever since the merge, when Ethereum went from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, the process in which blocks are built have created a vector for censorship. MEV or Maxium Extractible Value is a sort of strategy where the block builders (miners or validators) can rearrange, include, or exclude transactions to maximize their profits. '**MEV Boost'** acts as a mediator that can be used to give the validators a fair share of the MEV extracted.The problem is that MEV Boost is also complying with OFAC sanctions and has a blacklist of ethereum addresses that have been sanctioned by OFAC. Validators who run MEV Boost are effectively excluding any OFAC sanctioned Ethereum addresses from being added to a new block, which is censoring those addresses from interacting with the ethereum protocol.My questions are:1. Is my understanding above correct?2. Why did this become an issue post merge, how come Proof of Work did not have the same issues of censorship?3. Are those OFAC sanctioned Ethereum addresses completely blocked from transacting or are they just being ignored by the validators that are running MEV boost but they can still get included in Blocks from validators that are not complying with OFAC sanctions?4. On the [mevwatch.info](https://mevwatch.info/) website it has a 'censorship offenders leaderboard' which lists the validators that are censoring transactions. I noticed the biggest offenders are the largest validators like LIDO, Coinbase, Binance. I am assuming they are required to block these transactions, however it appears that only some of their validators are censoring transactions. For example: for Coinbase it shows that they have roughly 800 validators, however only 472 are censored which is 58% of their validators. Whats the deal with this? How come they are running some censored and some uncensored validators?Any insight or even a better explanation would greatly be appreciated.",False,MEV and censorship questions?,u/[deleted],0,99,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11cwdwo/mev_and_censorship_questions/,[]

Here are some other actions the IRS can take before resorting to jail time.1. Did you know that many exchanges already report to the IRS? When they send out 1099 forms, the IRS also gets a copy. If you decide not to report your crypto activity, you'll be first in line for a crypto tax audit!2. The IRS can assess a 20% accuracy-related penalty on understated tax. For example, if you didn't report your crypto and you owed $5,000 in taxes, the accuracy-related penalty would be $1,000. This penalty can be assessed for negligence or disregard for the rules.3. If the IRS does audit you and find you guilty of tax fraud, they can assess a 75% fraud penalty of the unpaid tax. This can even be done without opening a criminal investigation.4. What's the worst case scenario? Prison! Any attempt to cheat the IRS can be considered tax evasion or tax fraud. Both of these are felonies and can have a maximum penalty of $100,000 and 5 years in prison per each tax year.Bottom line is to always report your crypto!

This can be done in the event of a hack, which is easily solved by changing an account's signer.# Multicall TransactionsSince all accounts (i.e. our wallets) can have custom code, that can be used to bundle transactions together, just like the way smart contracts do. This means a token swap or NFT purchase takes 1 operation, instead of up to 4. This eliminates the need for infinite approvals, as everything necessary happens in one transaction, while also reducing gas costs for users.# Session KeysThanks to custom code, wallets can authorize platforms to perform specific functions for a set amount of time. This can make using exchanges or playing blockchain based games won't require authorization every time a repeated task is performed. It's instead authorized for some time to do those things by the session key.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/wi2pqxcvm6ka1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c02d441787985998662e9f2802c3dcb829b258f# Social RecoveryWith social recovery, anyone can appoint a number of guardian accounts. If a signer for a wallet is ever compromised, the guardians could vote to change the signer for that account themselves. Guardians can be added or removed by the signer themselves, but with a time delay. This presents an opportunity to recover a wallet from a compromise by depending on others you trust.# MFAMulti-Factor Authentication becomes possible, with an operation requiring approvals from several accounts before actually happening. While this is similar to milt-signature wallets, it is different. Multi-signature wallets are actually smart contracts that perform operations when several people authorize them. Account Abstraction on the other hand grants that ability directly to all wallets.https://preview.redd.it/ifou29p7l6ka1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=291b542df7939e99c7930de7a5ced70470b28bb2# Key RotatorThis presents the possibility of buying and selling accounts, since signers for those accounts can be changed. This could allow for the safe transfer of wallets with whitelists for upcoming NFT mints or even soulbound tokens, making them not so soulbound anymore.# Code Custom LogicWallets can have custom code which can be used to enhance or alter the functoins they perform. This custom code could be built by anyone and made available to the public as plugins. Imagine an App Store that added additional functionality to your wallet. That becomes possible.# Signers for Different OperationsWallets can have instances that are specific to the device they're on, only authorized to perform specific transactions. This could allow anyone to have a wallet on their phone that can only perform very basic operations, have spend limits, and cannot perform a transfer. An instance of a wallet on a home computer could be given broader access.# Gas in Other CurrenciesWith wallets having custom code, any currency can be used to pay for gas fees. Someone could pay for gas with USDC, for example. What actually happens is that the currency is swapped into ETH and used to pay for gas fees, all in the same transaction.# Spam FilterA spam filter also becomes a possibility, wherein anyone can permit inbound transfers to their wallet only from authorized sources. There will likely be services that compile safe senders, allowing anyone to import a list into their wallet of addresses that can make transfers to them.

However, the network has been facing some challenges in terms of scalability and transaction fees. In response, the Ethereum community has been exploring different solutions to address these issues, and one of them is the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). In this thread, we'll take a closer look at how zkEVM interacts with Ethereum Layer 1.Firstly, it's important to understand what zkEVM is. It's a layer 2 solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain, which helps to reduce gas costs and increase transaction throughput. In other words, zkEVM allows for more transactions to be processed without congesting the Ethereum network. However, it's not a standalone solution and needs to interact with the Ethereum Layer 1.The interaction between zkEVM and Ethereum Layer 1 happens through smart contracts. When a user wants to use zkEVM, they first need to create a smart contract on the Ethereum network. This contract is called a 'zkSync contract,' and it's used to lock up ETH or ERC-20 tokens. Once the tokens are locked, the user can interact with zkEVM to execute transactions off-chain.When a transaction is executed on zkEVM, it's verified through zero-knowledge proofs, which are then submitted to the zkSync contract on the Ethereum Layer 1. The zkSync contract then updates the user's balance on Ethereum Layer 1, reflecting the transaction that was executed off-chain. This means that the transaction is validated on Ethereum Layer 1, even though it was executed off-chain through zkEVM.In summary, zkEVM interacts with Ethereum Layer 1 through smart contracts. It allows for more transactions to be processed off-chain, which helps to reduce gas costs and increase transaction throughput. However, the transactions are still validated on Ethereum Layer 1 through a zkSync contract, ensuring their security and validity. As the Ethereum community continues to explore different solutions to address scalability and transaction fees, zkEVM is emerging as a promising solution that could help to address these challenges.",False,Understanding the Interaction between zkEVM and Ethereum Layer 1,u/[deleted],0,20,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11apllx/understanding_the_interaction_between_zkevm_and/,[]

It essentially serves as collateral; if a validator makes a mistake, such as proposing two blocks at once, they will lose some of the currency at stake (or be slashed, in other words).Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) make staked funds liquid and usable for other purposes. This is accomplished by issuing tokens that represent the ETH staked. When a user stakes ETH with an LSD provider, they will receive (ERC-20) tokens that allow them to redeem their deposit.  Before Ethereum, LSDs existed on other chains, such as Kusama/Polkadot, where unstacking can take up to 28 days. The popularity of LSD on Ethereum stems from the fact that it was previously unknown when withdrawals/unstacking would be possible. Ethereum withdrawals have now been confirmed as part of the Shanghai upgrade in March and will be covered in greater detail in a future write-up.&#x200B;**How Do LSDs Work?**The cToken model is used by the majority of LSDs. When you stake 1 ETH, you will receive 1 tokenETH, a token representing your deposit. The ETH deposited is pooled and grows as it accumulates rewards. You can get your deposit and share of the rewards back by exchanging tokenETH for ETH.&#x200B;There is no 1:1 ratio between the token and the staked asset in LSD systems. There will always be fewer tokenETH than there are ETH. As the amount of ETH staked grows with rewards, so does the amount that can be redeemed with tokenETH. This is why LSD token prices aren't always the same as ETH prices at any given time.  Staking on ETH and receiving rewards on that staked ETH on a regular basis is an alternative to LSD. This can be accomplished by directly staking 32 ETH or by participating in programs that offer to stake but do not provide a token in exchange. The rewards are paid out in ETH based on the performance of the validator.Staking with Coinbase, for example, provides a user with a 3% yield in ETH. Alternatively, you can participate in the LSD and receive cbETH tokens after you stake with Coinbase. When you do this, you will no longer directly accumulate ETH rewards; instead, you will exchange the cbETH for ETH in exchange for a share of the pool's rewards.## Providers of LSDThere are various LSD providers, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. There are up to 20 staking services to choose from, with up to 7 offering an LSD, according to Beaconchain. From most centralized to least centralized, here are the major LSD providers and a brief explanation of each.## Exchanges that are centralisedThere are centralized exchanges that provide LSDs; these are the simplest but also the most expensive solutions. Fees on centralized exchanges can reach up to 30% ‚Äî that is, 30% of rewards go to Coinbase before the rest is distributed to stakes.When staking with a centralized exchange, the nodes are entirely run by their employees. The cToken model is used by exchanges such as Coinbase. To exchange the LSD ETH for regular ETH, centralized exchanges required identity verification or KYC.## LIDOLIDO is one of the first Ethereum LSD providers. They allow anyone to stake any amount of ETH in exchange for stETH. The LIDO DAO appoints potential validators and distributes ETH to them. LIDO takes 10% of rewards, with half going to validators and the other half going to a DAO treasury to be used as needed.The cToken model described above is not used by LIDO. Instead, the DAO chooses oracles to aggregate the balances of all validators using LIDO ETH. The supply of stETH is then adjusted based on whether there is a net increase or decrease. If a day ends with more rewards, stETH is distributed. Otherwise, some stETH is burned. The supply of stETH is adjusted in this manner on a daily basis.## Pool of RocketsStakers and node operators are two types of independent participants in Rocket Pool. Stakers can deposit any amount they want, while node operators must have at least 16 ETH. Stakers contribute 16 ETH to node operators, which is used to set up a validator node. Node operators receive 15% of the rewards generated for ETH staked on others' behalf.Only stakers, not node operators, receive the rETH LSD in Rocket Pool. This means that node operators get paid directly, whereas stakers get paid the LSD way: by exchanging rETH for ETH. The cToken model is used by Rocket Pool's LSD.Rocket Pool's upcoming Atlas upgrade will allow node operators to participate by depositing 8 ETH rather than the current 16.Finally, LSDs allows you to be in two places at the same time. Staking ETH can generate yield, and a token equivalent can be used in DeFi to generate additional yield. LSDs' flexibility makes them an appealing option for many new stakeholders. They come at the expense of some lost reward fees, but the benefit is the flexibility and the elimination of the need to set up a validator node at home.   It is my hope that LSD providers will make staking more accessible in the future, and that more people will be able (and willing) to set up their own nodes. There is a serious risk of centralized LSD providers staking too much ETH, but they allow many newcomers to participate in staking.

So, I believe that shifting to Web 3 is key for GameFi, just take a look at how awesome is that switch from WAM to a new version of WAM 3.0, there is plenty of great stuff now.

To my surprise the moderator said this was ok'd by the team as long as they weren't canceling bids with bots.

Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

Blockchain games set themselves apart from traditional video games by providing players free crypto, NFTs or other assets which can ultimately be exchanged for fiat currencies. With the rise in popularity of AI, Metaverse and NFT based tokens, we can expect a similar trend to spillover in the blockchain P2E space too. The market is saturated with all sorts of P2E games, a lot of which may not ultimately prove to be worth one's time and effort. However, after searching the market for a good bit, heres a quick look at my top 10 p2e blockchain games that seem to be worthwhile. 1) **Illuvium (ILV)** is a sci-fi adventure NFT creature collector and autobattler game that enables players to explore 7 alien landscapes. Players uncover the events that shattered Illuvium and can hunt and capture over 100 deadly beasts that rule the alien territory.2) **Alien Worlds (TLM)** is one of the best P2E games, attracting more than 3.6 million users since inception and more than 700,000 monthly players. It's another sci-fi game that enables players to explore space and scrub various planets for resources.3) **The Sandbox (SAND)** is of the top P2E games that enable players to choose from more than 140,000 avatars is The Sandbox. Players use their avatars to play in the Sandbox and to build, own and monetize their piece of LAND. 4) **Axie Infinity (AXS)** many gamers consider Axie Infinity as the pioneering platform of play to earn blockchain games. This NFT game enables players to collect and mint NFTs, which represent digital pets known as Axies.5) **Vulcan Verse (PYR)**  is a decentralized open world blockchain game where you can travel around and interact with games and events. Vulcan Forged, one of the leading platforms in this space is the blockchain gaming studio that has developed this game. The MMORPG game is built using blockchain technology and consists of land parcels represented by NFTs.6) **Decentraland (MANA)** is the first virtual world owned by its users, enabling them to create, explore and buy LAND, a plot in the Metaverse. Players can explore LANDs to experience majestic scenery such as medieval dungeon mazes and villages. 7) **Battle Infinity (IBAT)** proved since its presale that it would be one of the best P2E games to watch this year. The key attraction of Battle Infinity is earning rewards on 6 platforms. Players can enter the IBAT Premier League and build up teams to compete for rewards. Another way to earn is by monetizing land. 8) **RobotEra (TARO)** is a promising new play-to-earn crypto game that puts earning opportunities directly in the hands of the people. Players can explore a vast virtual land, acquiring resources and turning a profit along the way.9) **Lucky Block (LBLOCK)** is a popular cryptocurrency ecosystem that has just launched a new casino and sportsbook offering more than 2,700 games, sports betting, enticing bonuses and no fees.10) **Tamadoge (TAMA)** this is a promising P2E game since its early in its roadmap with high potential in the long term. Its native token TAMA is also a meme coin that separates itself from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by having a real world utility. Players can earn TAMA tokens by exercising, feeding and nurturing their pets.What are your thoughts on this?

However, as the network grows, it is becoming increasingly clear that the existing infrastructure may not be able to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for transactions.Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks are two different types of Ethereum networks that offer different features and capabilities. L1 is the main Ethereum blockchain, which is used for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. It is the backbone of the entire Ethereum ecosystem and is responsible for securing the network.On the other hand, L2 networks are built on top of L1 and are designed to improve the scalability and speed of transactions. They are often referred to as 'off-chain' solutions because they allow transactions to be processed outside of the main blockchain. L2 networks offer faster transaction processing times, lower fees, and greater scalability than L1, making them an attractive option for users who want to save time and money.As the Ethereum network continues to grow, many users are starting to shift towards L2 solutions to overcome the limitations of the L1 network. With the current congestion and high fees on the L1 network, many users are finding it challenging to use the network for small transactions, which has led to a growing interest in L2 networks.The idea of having L1 networks reserved for large businesses and institutions while L2 networks interact exclusively with each other has been gaining traction among the Ethereum community. This approach could help to reduce the strain on the L1 network and improve the scalability of the overall network. Additionally, it could lead to increased adoption of L2 solutions, as users become more comfortable with off-chain transactions.One of the primary benefits of using L2 networks is that they allow for instant transactions at a significantly lower cost than L1. This makes them an attractive option for users who need to make small transactions frequently. However, the current challenge is that L2 networks are still in their early stages, and not all applications are compatible with them.There are several types of L2 solutions, including state channels, plasma, and sidechains. Each of these solutions has its unique features, and some are better suited for specific use cases than others. For example, state channels are ideal for games and micropayments, while plasma is better suited for more complex transactions that require more processing power.Despite the advantages of L2 networks, there are some challenges that must be addressed before they can become a viable alternative to L1. One of the most significant challenges is interoperability between different L2 solutions. Currently, there is no standardization for L2 networks, which can make it challenging for them to work together seamlessly.In conclusion, the idea of reserving L1 networks for large businesses and institutions while L2 networks interact exclusively with each other is an intriguing concept that could help to reduce the strain on the L1 network and improve the scalability of the overall network. However, this will require a significant amount of collaboration and innovation within the Ethereum community to develop new standards and protocols for L2 networks. With the current pace of development and the increasing interest in L2 solutions, it is likely that we will see significant progress in this area over the next few years.",False,Embracing L2 Networks: A Future Where Ethereum's L1 is Reserved for Enterprises and L2s Interact Exclusively with Each Other,u/[deleted],0,4,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/111veqh/embracing_l2_networks_a_future_where_ethereums_l1/,[]

Where NFT games cost tons of money to play, and while they're fun, are just way too unaffordable.Enter, The Game of Life, on Ethereum. Most NFT games are super engaging, and want you to play every day, like the trillions of games, on Ethereum and non-crypto based. I propose a situation that puts the focus on *you*, and your progression as a human being. From birth, we are born into the ideal of what our parents believe in, they teach us things, and they give us advice. When we reach adulthood, we lead almost boring lives, filled with work, and the upsides of life, like Ethereum! The Game of Life was one of my favorite childhood games to play and made you experience this Tomodachi mini-me who had to face life's problems, and maybe win the lottery or buy a swanky house.What if, on Ethereum, your life could be documented and gamified into your own board. You play by your rules, get your first job, move somewhere new, or get married. All of these life events would be documented onchain, but not the Google stuff, your birthday or your name. The stuff that *really* matters, like your major life events. When you die, you won't be left with a gravestone, but a history of *you*, who you were, forever lasting on the blockchain. Your move to Germany or Japan would last forever. On Ethereum, *you* wouldn't be collecting moss and dead flowers, you would flourish and live on the blockchain.This game would still be a play-to-earn game, in the form of LIFE tiles, or my idea, $TILE coin, which would not only be a nice way of earning some crypto, but actually have sentimental value to *you*. These tile coins and NFTs would be a memory that you and Ethereum users will never forget.Wrapping up, is this a good idea? Would you play the game? Would you be comfortable to sharing life events like this for the rewards and memory you receive?Let me know your thoughts in the comments below! I will, also, be ensuring that this game is free-to-play with the optional fun of earning more $TILE with NFTs that are fairly priced ($10-50).",False,The Game of Life | On Ethereum | Thoughts?,u/[deleted],0,1,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/111llxh/the_game_of_life_on_ethereum_thoughts/,[]

In other words, SMT solvers determine whether a given logical formula can be true or false based on a set of logical and mathematical rules.SMT solvers are used in various applications such as software verification, formal verification of hardware designs, optimization, and automated theorem proving. They are highly effective in solving complex logical problems, as they can make use of efficient algorithms, heuristics, and decision procedures to explore the space of possible solutions.Read more -> [SMTChecker and SMT Solvers: Exploring Formal Verification One Step at a Time](https://www.truscova.com/blog_article_7.php)",False,SMTChecker and SMT Solvers: Exploring Formal Verification One Step at a Time,u/[deleted],0,15,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/111h3od/smtchecker_and_smt_solvers_exploring_formal/,[]

The case was that users that submitted data through private smart contracts could be issued a confidential NFT, and then the holders of these data NFTs would be paid whenever their data was used (differential privacy (it basically adds noise) would secure it and only deliver an aggregated form of the data to the ones pulling it, so the sensitive information would still remain confidential) they'd be paid in tokens.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

When someone stakes ETH with a LSD provider, they'll receive (ERC-20) tokens that allow for the redemption of their deposit. https://preview.redd.it/l9y99klewdha1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b80e5d2972df8035ce834ffb31f28d429ef7ea7bLSDs existed on other chains before Ethereum, including Kusama/Polkadot for example, where unstaking can involve a 28-day wait period. The reason for LSDs popularity on Ethereum is that until recently, it's been unclear when withdrawals/unstaking would become possible. Ethereum withdrawals are now confirmed to be coming with the Shanghai upgrade in March and will be covered in more detail in a future write-up.&#x200B;# How LSDs WorkMost LSDs follow the [cToken model](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/). When you stake 1 ETH, you'll receive a token representing your deposit, 1 *token*ETH. The deposited ETH is pooled together, and grows as it accumulates rewards. You can redeem your deposit and share of rewards by exchanging *token*ETH back for ETH.In LSD systems, there isn't a 1:1 ratio between the token and the staked asset. There will always be less of the *token*ETH than ETH. As ETH the staked grows with rewards, the amount that can be redeemed with *token*ETH does as well. This is the reason why LSD token prices aren't always the same price that ETH may be at a given time.https://preview.redd.it/t9sauu7qvdha1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdbe817242b9fa8ea4c1b04c5e3237d33df46069The alternative to LSD is staking on ETH and obtaining rewards on that staked ETH periodically. This can be through staking 32 ETH directly, or programs that offer staking but not a token in return. The rewards are paid out in ETH based on the validator's performance.For example, staking with Coinbase awards a user with a '~3% yield that is paid in ETH. Alternatively, once you stake with Coinbase you can choose to participate in the LSD and receive cbETH tokens. When you do that, you'll no longer directly accumulate ETH rewards, you'll redeem the cbETH for ETH instead for a share of the pools rewards.&#x200B;# LSD ProvidersDifferent LSD providers exist with varying pros and cons. According to [Beaconchain](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices), there are as many as 20 staking services to choose from, with up to 7 offering a LSD. Below are the major LSD providers and a quick explanation of each, from most to least centralized.https://preview.redd.it/jgwq2ltlwdha1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21462d3bd25d0a75ef9a189ab8bddd4edcaffc36# Centralized ExchangesThere exist centralized exchanges that offer LSDs, these are the most simple solutions but also the most expensive. Centralized exchanges can take up to 30% in fees - that's 30% of rewards that go to Coinbase before the rest are distributes amongst stakers.When staking with a centralized exchange, the nodes are operated entirely by their staff. Exchanges including Coinbase use the cToken model. It is worth noting that centralized exchanges required identity verification, or KYC, to exchange the LSD ETH for regular ETH.&#x200B;# LIDOLIDO is one of the first LSD providers on Ethereum. They allow anyone to stake any amount of ETH and receive stETH in return. ETH is distributed to potential validators that are appointed by the LIDO DAO. LIDO charges 10% of rewards, half goes to validators and the other half goes to a DAO treasury that can be used as needed.LIDO does not use the cToken model described above. Instead, oracles are selected by the DAO to aggregate the balances of all validators using LIDO ETH. Then, based on whether there is a net increase or decrease, the supply of stETH is adjusted. If a day ends with more rewards, some stETH is issued. If not, some stETH is burned. stETH supply is adjusted this way daily.&#x200B;# Rocket PoolRocket Pool has two groups of independent participants, stakers and node operators. Node operators must have at least 16 ETH, and stakers can deposit any amount they'd like. Node operators are complemented with 16 ETH from stakers, which is used to set up a validator node. Node operators take 15% of rewards generated for ETH they stake on behalf of others.In Rocket Pool's case, only stakers are given the rETH LSD, not node operators. This means that node operators obtain their yield directly, whereas stakers receive their reward the LSD way: by exchanging rETH for ETH. Rocket Pool's LSD uses the cToken model. With the upcoming Atlas upgrade, Rocket Pool will allow node operators to participate by depositing 8 ETH instead of the current 16.&#x200B;# In ConclusionLSDs offer an opportunity to be in two places at once. ETH can accrue yield through staking, and a token equivalent can be used in DeFi to generate additional yield. The flexibility of LSDs make them an attractive option for many stakers getting started. They come at the cost of some reward fees lost, but the benefit is the flexibility and lack of a need to set up a validator node at home.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/i2kx6c0cwdha1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d69c3ff1286c9df134d3fd5b7875c5e3ea70d77bIt is my hope that LSD providers make staking more accessible, but that more people are able (and willing) to set up their own nodes in the future. There is a serious risk in centralized LSD providers having too much of the ETH staked, but they enable participation in staking for many starting out. &#x200B;Thanks a lot for reading!

Otherwise you are essentially facilitating scammers by providing a false sense of credibility and trustworthiness. I don't believe this mentality will scale given larger adoption in the future. Given the size of OpenSea it would make more sense to assume a NFT to be fake and manually verifying it rather than manually marking it as fake.

However it is probably contentious. If the IP address of the computer that sent a transaction to the mempool were to be appended to the transaction, would this allow for scammers to be tracked? As an aside, I can definitely see how this would be contentious. Everyone from people who are just privacy concious to the people who scoff at the irs would hate this. And if people were to escalate by using vpns, the natural counter of using blacklists that prevent vpn addresses of known vpns from publishing to the eth blockchain creates a situation where someone could add addresses of people they dislike (like hackers or the north korean govt) to the blockchain to block access, and then it becomes a cat and mouse game of moving money by juggling ip addresses. But back to the basic premise. Would this assist in stopping the rampant theft occuring on the ethereum blockchain? Could the essence of this idea have safeguards added to it that cut out the potential bad part (along with the ensuing arms race) and still retain the core idea? For example, what if the majority of eth stakers had to agree to an unmasking of the IP address, and the ip address were protected behind encryption that could only be broken through mass consensus? This would prevent the power from falling into wrong hands, and ensure its only used by people who have the approval of the entire community to see that specific transaction IP address.

It makes financial policies, and directs the Financial Supervisory Service, an integrated financial regulator that examines and supervises financial institutions.¬†According to the regulator, the digital assets that fit the characteristics of securities as defined in the Capital Markets Act, will be regulated as securities in the nation. It further explains that cryptocurrencies that offer a stake in business operations, and give holders rights to dividends, residual assets, or business profits, will fall under the category of securities under the Capital Markets Act.Reportedly, the securities regulations mandates public disclosure requirements and prohibit unfair trade practices to protect the rights of investors.However, sources reveal that the FSC said that cryptocurrencies that do not fall into the category of securities, however, will be regulated by the upcoming Framework Act on Digital Assets.¬†Notably, the digital assets that do not have an issuer, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), will not be considered securities. The FSC will also permit Security Token Offerings (STOs) by making amendments to its Electronic Securities Act.In November Todayq News [reported](https://news.todayq.com/news/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-to-be-referred-exclusively-as-digital-assets-in-south-korea/) The Special Financial Transactions Act, which was introduced in 2021 by the South Korean government, gave legal status to the concept of digital assets. According to the law, digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum will no longer be referred to as cryptocurrencies but rather as Digital Assets.¬†However, the FSC stated that token issuers and brokers, like crypto exchanges, will be required to assess which cryptocurrencies are securities on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to how companies have to self-determine whether they are issuing securities and follow the applicable regulations.South Korean authorities have eagerly looked forward to establishing regulation for crypto assets. They have marked it as a [priority](https://news.todayq.com/news/south-korean-regulator-prioritizes-crypto-regulation-in-their-2023-work-plan/) for their 2023 Work Plan.The Ministry of Justice in South Korea also revealed [plans](https://news.todayq.com/news/south-korean-authorities-want-a-crypto-transactions-tracker-to-go-after-criminals/) to develop a crypto-tracking system dubbed- Virtual Currency Tracking System- to tackle money laundering initiatives and recover funds linked to criminal activities. The country essentially seeks to monitor transaction history, extract transaction-related data, and check the source of funds before and after the remittance.Sources reveal that the newly built system is expected to be deployed in the first half of 2023. According to the South Korean ministry, the development of the tracking and analysis system will start in the second half of the year.source: [https://news.todayq.com/news/btc-and-eth-will-not-be-regulated-as-securities-in-south-korea/](https://news.todayq.com/news/btc-and-eth-will-not-be-regulated-as-securities-in-south-korea/)",False,BTC and ETH will not be regulated as securities in South Korea,u/[deleted],0,24,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/10v9chl/btc_and_eth_will_not_be_regulated_as_securities/,[]

It is the logical endpoint where everything is priced in Bitcoin and Bitcoin is the only accepted currency around the world.I want to play devil's advocate here. Please share your ideas:A common trope in crypto memes is the wage slave. In short: A poor wagie has to work for a boomer boss, only earning a few dollars per hour. One day he buys bitcoin and gets rich - thus escaping the wage slavery. Let's see how hyperbitcoinization would affect this class of people.In our scenario, everything is priced in Bitcoin (or Satoshis). The dollar price may be in the billions or even trillions per Bitcoin, but this is as irrelevant as pricing something in ancient roman currency today. As you know, Bitcoins can not be printed by a central bank. They have to be mined. In our theoretical world, mining would be so unprofitable that only the biggest companies can do it. Imagine a company the size of Amazon or Apple dedicating 100% of its power and ressources to bitcoin mining. As everyone on the planet wants to mine the only accepted world currency, the mining difficulty level gets so hard that even big mining pools can't realistically compete. Oh, and there is also the halvening cycle too.How would a typical 18 year old guy born into this world, get Bitcoin then? Remember: He needs bitcoin for everything he wants to buy, even food. Well we concluded that he can't mine it and short of a gift from his parents, he would have to provide some kind of service in exchange for Bitcoins / Satoshis. We could call this exchange: labor / work / jobRick would say: This is wage slavery with extra steps.So this young man applies for a job where he can exchange his time for Bitcoin. But who is the entity that can hire him. Who can provide him with Bitcoin in exchange for his work? Who has so many Bitcoins that he can give it to someone else instead of using them himself?The boomers will be late to jump on the bitcoin train (if at all). They will not be the hodlers of the new currency. So there won't be boomer bosses anymore. It is pretty simple who has the most  buying power in terms of Bitcoin in the future:This community.Most people reading this will be the new wage-slave masters in the future. Like it or not. Even if you only have 0.01 Bitcoin today, this translates to 1,000,000 Satoshis. In a future where the whole world economy runs on a maximum of 21 million bitcoins, you are part of the '1%'. The 'financial elite'. Someone needs your bitcoins / satoshis to survive and you can ask for goods or services in return. Oh, and you can set the price! Some 18 year old wants a job to pay his rent and get some food? You can offer to send him 500 satoshis every month if he provides you with 40 hours of work every week. What? Some other 18 year old will do it for only 400 satoshis? Well that's the price then.Hyperbitcoinization thus leads to the rise of a new kind of wagie: The Bitcoin Wagie. The Bitcoin wagie sells his time for a fraction of a Bitcoin (Satoshis). He can barely afford anything, let alone buying a house. The old Bitcoin hodlers (that's you, reader) bought so many houses with their new found wealth, that a bitcoin wagie can only dream of his own home. (Looks familiar?) But it get's worse: The Bitcoin Wagie can't even invest in Bitcoin to have some hope of getting rich in the future because he already lives in the hyperbitcoinized future. He was only unlucky enough to be born after the monster rally that killed the dollar. As governments can't print bitcoins, they have no power over the monetary supply. This means that they can't create inflation at will - which is good. But how would they take care of the country? Run Schools, etc.? There needs to be some kind of tax system. As nobody can be taxed automatically in bitcoin, the government could resort to harsher tax laws and force you to send bitcoins to a government wallet each year in order to avoid jailtime. This can be a slippery slope into a much darker form of wage slavery. Who want's to pay taxes in bitcoin?It seems like the best scenario is not hyperbitcoinization but a constant, yet not too fast rise of the dollar price for 1 Bitcoin. Governments inflate the dollar, but they also tax you in dollars. You hodl Bitcoin and get a little bit richer every year.What is your opinion? Do you see a future where these problems can be solved? -----TLDR:Hyperbitcoinization leads to our community being the new wage-slave masters. There will be a new class of wagie: The Bitcoin Wagie. They will exchange time for a few Satoshis. 'Rick: This is wage slavery with extra steps'. Governments can't print bitcoins but they could tax you in bitcoin. Who wants that?

In its simplest definition, Blockchain  technology is a unique way of securely storing and sharing information.  It works by using a network of computers, each containing a copy of the  same information.   So whenever a new piece of information is  added, it is verified by the entire network before being added to the  'blockchain'. This makes it very difficult for anyone to tamper with or  alter the information.  If you've ever played a game with your  friends and needed someone to keep score? And let's imagine everyone had  a paper to write down the scores, and whenever a point was added,  everyone else could see it too! That's kind of like what Blockchain is.   It's  a way to keep track of things, like money or information, that is safe  and fair for everyone. It's like a special book that nobody can cheat on  or change, and everyone can look at it to make sure everything is  accurate.   People can use Blockchain to help make important  things better, like how doctors keep track of our health, or how we pay  for things we buy. It's so cool.  Blockchain has the potential to  change the way we do things. Imagine making secure and fast transactions  without having to go through banks or other intermediaries. That's what  Blockchain can do  Blockchain isn't limited to money alone, it  could be used to store data and information. I.e It could be used in  healthcare to keep your medical records safe and secure while allowing  you to easily share them with your doctors.   It can also be used  in supply chain management to track products from start to finish, so  you can be sure you're getting what you paid for.  So, Blockchain  is tamper-proof, so you can trust that the information on it is accurate  and reliable. This makes it perfect for things also like voting, where  we want to make sure the results are fair and honest.  As  Blockchain continues to evolve and become more widely adopted, we can  expect to see even more exciting applications and uses of this  innovative technology.   It has the potential to transform many industries in positive ways, and we're excited to see where it goes from here. https://preview.redd.it/8502lkge1psa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d4d38c69865fb96dc6d79cd08ec2e22a77a86e1",False,Introduction to Blockchain,u/[deleted],0,0,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12fse9o/introduction_to_blockchain/,[]

Nodes that fully verify all of the rules of Bitcoin are called full nodes. The most popular software implementation of full nodes is called Bitcoin Core, its latest release can be found on the github page.What makes a full node? Full nodes download every block and transaction and check them against Bitcoin's consensus rules. Here are examples of consensus rules, though there are many more:Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 6.25 BTC per block.) Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent. Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format. Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent. If a transaction or block violates the consensus rules, then it is absolutely rejected, even if every other node on the network thinks that it is valid. This is one of the most important characteristics of full nodes: they do what's right no matter what. For full nodes, miners actually have fairly limited power: they can only reorder or remove transactions, and only by spending a lot of computing power. A powerful miner is able to execute some serious attacks, but because full nodes rely on miners only for a few things, miners could not completely change or destroy Bitcoin.Nodes that have different consensus rules are actually using two different networks/currencies. Changing any of the consensus rules requires a hard fork, which can be thought of as creating a new currency and having everyone move to it. Consensus rules are different from policy rules, which specify how a node or miner prioritizes or discourages certain things. Policy rules can be changed freely, and different nodes can have different policy rules. Because all full nodes must use exactly the same consensus rules in order to remain compatible with each other, even duplicating bugs and oddities in the original consensus rules, creating a full node from scratch is extremely difficult and dangerous. It is therefore recommended that everyone who wishes to run a full node uses software based on the reference client, which is the only client guaranteed to behave correctly.At minimum, a full node must download every transaction that has ever taken place, all new transactions, and all block headers. Additionally, full nodes must store information about every unspent transaction output until it is spent. By default full nodes are inefficient in that they download each new transaction at least twice, and they store the entire block chain (more than 165 GB as of 20180214) forever, even though only the unspent transaction outputs (<2 GB) are required. Performance can improved by enabling -blocksonly mode and enabling pruning.Archival Nodes A subset of full nodes also accept incoming connections and upload old blocks to other peers on the network. This happens if the software is run with -listen=1 as is default. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, being an archival node is not necessary to being a full node. If a user's bandwidth is constrained then they can use -listen=0, if their disk space is constrained they can use pruning, all the while still being a fully-validating node that enforces bitcoin's consensus rules and contributing to bitcoin's overall security.Why should you use a full node wallet Summary Running a full node is the only way you can use Bitcoin in a trustless way. You will know for sure that all the rules of Bitcoin are being followed, for example that no bitcoins are spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work (e.g. difficulty) are followed. Full nodes are currently the most private way to use Bitcoin, with nobody else learning which bitcoin addresses belong to you. Full nodes are the most secure way to use Bitcoin, they do not suffer from many attacks that affect lightweight wallets.Economic strength This is by far the most important reason for running a full node, though it is a little difficult to understand.As explained previously, full nodes enforce the consensus rules no matter what. However, lightweight nodes do not do this. Lightweight nodes do whatever the majority of mining power says. Therefore, if most of the miners got together to increase their block reward, for example, lightweight nodes would blindly go along with it. If this ever happened, the network would split such that lightweight nodes and full nodes would end up on separate networks, using separate currencies. People using lightweight nodes would be unable to transact with people using full nodes. If all businesses and many users are using full nodes, then this network split is not a critical problem because users of lightweight clients will quickly notice that they can't send or receive bitcoins to/from most of the people who they usually do business with, and so they'll stop using Bitcoin until the evil miners are overcome, which is the appropriate response. However, if almost everyone on the network is using lightweight nodes in this situation, then everyone would continue being able to transact with each other, and so Bitcoin could very well end up 'hijacked' by evil miners.In practice, miners are unlikely to attempt anything like the above scenario as long as full nodes are prevalent because the miners would lose a lot of money. But the incentives completely change if everyone uses lightweight nodes. In that case, miners definitely do have an incentive to change Bitcoin's rules in their favor. It is only reasonably secure to use a lightweight node because most of the Bitcoin economy uses full nodes.Therefore, it is critical for Bitcoin's survival that the great majority of the Bitcoin economy be backed by full nodes, not lightweight nodes. This is especially important for Bitcoin businesses, which have more economic weight. To contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength, you must actually use a full node for your real transactions (or use a lightweight node connected to a full node that you personally control). Just running a full node on a server somewhere does not contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength.More details https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lndPrivacy Downloading the entire blockchain is the most private way to operate a wallet. All other lightweight solutions leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers. The Electrum servers will know which addresses belong to you and can link them together. Despite bloom filtering, SPV nodes based on BitcoinJ do not provide much privacy against nodes who connected directly to the wallet.[1]For some use cases, such privacy may not be required. But an important reason to run a full node and use it as a wallet is to get the full privacy benefits.Security Lightweight nodes are sometimes able to be temporarily tricked into accepting transactions or blocks that are not actually valid. This could cause serious financial damage, especially for websites that automatically process Bitcoin transactions. Full nodes provide the maximum security possible, and so they should be used by all businesses, and also by regular users whenever doing so is convenient.Network services Full nodes may provide various services to other network participants (if the software is run with -listen=1 as is default). This is especially important for lightweight nodes.These services include:Filtering transactions and blocks on behalf of lightweight nodes so that lightweight nodes do not need to download every transaction ever made on the network in order to find their own transactions. Serving historical full blocks to nodes that have been offline for a while. Transmitting new transactions from users to miners. Broadcasting new blocks from miners to other nodes. For the most part, these services are only usefully performed by full nodes that are listening on port 8333. The more full nodes that accept incoming connections there are, the more users the Bitcoin network can support. Although if there is ever a shortage, lots of archival nodes can be easily created by cheaply renting VPS or AWS space.Some are incentivizing it Bitnodes ran a program to incentivize full node operators until the end of 2015.[2]How to run a full node If you run the Bitcoin Core/bitcoind wallet, you are running a full node. If you open port 8333, you will contribute to the network's capacity. If you actually use the wallet feature, or if you use a lightweight client like MultiBit but configure it to connect exclusively to your full node, then you will contribute to the network's economic strength and receive protection from some possible attacks against lightweight nodes.There are a few alternate full node implementations, but they are not recommended for serious use because it is currently difficult to determine whether they implement the consensus rules with 100% accuracy. Even very slight inaccuracies could cause serious problems for the users of these alternate clients.

Here's something that helped reassure me a lot:There was some interesting research done by Schwab Center for Financial Research related to the S&P 500, which can be applied to Bitcoin strategies too. A couple of years ago this information helped to remove my hesitation and fear about whether it was a good time or bad time to buy Bitcoin.In their research, they analyzed the previous 20 years of S&P 500 data with 5 different investing strategies. Each of the 5 made-up investors received $2K per year to invest, and each varied when they would've invested it, for example:1. Investing all $2K on the BEST day each year with perfect timing2. Investing all $2K IMMEDIATELY upon receipt (on the 1st available day of the year)3. Investing monthly (Dollar Cost Averaging / DCA; submit $166.66 per month)4. Investing all  $2K on the WORST day of each year with bad timing5. Not investing or in this case leaving it in TREASURY bills (basically not investing)The results are stunning, after $2K/yr for 20yrs ($40K total), they made:1. Perfect timing investor = $151,3912. Immediate receipt investor = $135,4713. DCA = $134,8564. Worst Possible Timing = $121,1715. Not investing/Treasury = $44,438We could discuss the reason for the differences, but the point I am making is that when I applied this to Bitcoin, I stopped caring if it was a bull run or Bear Market or 'good time' or 'bad time,' because even the person who bought at the WORST POSSIBLE time every year without fail still came out WAY ON TOP.We could do the exact same thing with Bitcoin through nearly any period and I would guess that even the people who bought at the absolute worst possible time every single time without fail would still be way ahead overall (IF they ALSO played the LONG GAME HODL'ING...not day-trading) just like the S&P 500 worst timing investor doing it worst over 20yrs, but never selling out. In fact, the worst-timing investor in the S&P didn't really lose out all that much. They still 3x'd their investment and made nearly 3 times more than the person who was too scared to do anything but HODL their FIAT. Yes, DCA made more money than the person who invested at the WORST time each year, but not by a HUGE margin. Even the worst possible timing person came out way ahead of the dollar holder. All because they played the long game. That is what HODL'ing BTC is all about too.So to me, it's less important about 'WHEN' I am investing in BTC (ie: 'Is it the best or worst time to buy more?'). The most important thing is that I am investing at all (I personally choose DCA with no intent to touch it for decades). Once I saw that NOT investing actually cost that poor sap so much compared to the next worst strategy, I realized the real mistake was not taking any action. Waiting and holding FIAT is NOT 'playing it safe'...that fear of bad timing was costing them WAY more than the worst possible timing.Of course, all of the above assumes that a person is in it for the long haul...in this case, 20 years. I won't give 'investment advice' to anyone else (make up your own mind, and don't blame me for sharing my own experience), but to me, this drove home the point that inaction is a lot more costly than blowing off the fear about bad timing and just doing something regularly. In the LONG RUN, there is no 'bad timing.' Bitcoin has never lost money in any 4 year period, and I expect it never will due to the halving cycles, and definitely won't over the very long term. I don't intend to sell off my stacked sats, and I tell loved ones that if they ever buy BTC to never consider re-evaluating their BTC investment any shorter than 4 years minimum, and the longer the better. That's the point this drives home to me: 'Get over your fear that it might be a bad time. Ignore that because you're doing it for the long-game HODL'ing anyway, and in the LONG-game, there is no 'bad timing.' BTC's paradox is that it can be extremely unpredictable in the short-term while being among the most predictable, stable, safe, and secure in the long-term.'**I'd love to hear what helped you finally get over your fear of 'bad timing' and finally decide to start investing regularly.**",False,This helped reassure me against 'bad timing' fears related to buying BTC.

Nodes that fully verify all of the rules of Bitcoin are called full nodes. The most popular software implementation of full nodes is called Bitcoin Core, its latest release can be found on the github page.What makes a full node? Full nodes download every block and transaction and check them against Bitcoin's consensus rules. Here are examples of consensus rules, though there are many more:Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 6.25 BTC per block.) Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent. Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format. Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent. If a transaction or block violates the consensus rules, then it is absolutely rejected, even if every other node on the network thinks that it is valid. This is one of the most important characteristics of full nodes: they do what's right no matter what. For full nodes, miners actually have fairly limited power: they can only reorder or remove transactions, and only by spending a lot of computing power. A powerful miner is able to execute some serious attacks, but because full nodes rely on miners only for a few things, miners could not completely change or destroy Bitcoin.Nodes that have different consensus rules are actually using two different networks/currencies. Changing any of the consensus rules requires a hard fork, which can be thought of as creating a new currency and having everyone move to it. Consensus rules are different from policy rules, which specify how a node or miner prioritizes or discourages certain things. Policy rules can be changed freely, and different nodes can have different policy rules. Because all full nodes must use exactly the same consensus rules in order to remain compatible with each other, even duplicating bugs and oddities in the original consensus rules, creating a full node from scratch is extremely difficult and dangerous. It is therefore recommended that everyone who wishes to run a full node uses software based on the reference client, which is the only client guaranteed to behave correctly.At minimum, a full node must download every transaction that has ever taken place, all new transactions, and all block headers. Additionally, full nodes must store information about every unspent transaction output until it is spent. By default full nodes are inefficient in that they download each new transaction at least twice, and they store the entire block chain (more than 165 GB as of 20180214) forever, even though only the unspent transaction outputs (<2 GB) are required. Performance can improved by enabling -blocksonly mode and enabling pruning.Archival Nodes A subset of full nodes also accept incoming connections and upload old blocks to other peers on the network. This happens if the software is run with -listen=1 as is default. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, being an archival node is not necessary to being a full node. If a user's bandwidth is constrained then they can use -listen=0, if their disk space is constrained they can use pruning, all the while still being a fully-validating node that enforces bitcoin's consensus rules and contributing to bitcoin's overall security.Why should you use a full node wallet Summary Running a full node is the only way you can use Bitcoin in a trustless way. You will know for sure that all the rules of Bitcoin are being followed, for example that no bitcoins are spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work (e.g. difficulty) are followed. Full nodes are currently the most private way to use Bitcoin, with nobody else learning which bitcoin addresses belong to you. Full nodes are the most secure way to use Bitcoin, they do not suffer from many attacks that affect lightweight wallets.Economic strength This is by far the most important reason for running a full node, though it is a little difficult to understand.As explained previously, full nodes enforce the consensus rules no matter what. However, lightweight nodes do not do this. Lightweight nodes do whatever the majority of mining power says. Therefore, if most of the miners got together to increase their block reward, for example, lightweight nodes would blindly go along with it. If this ever happened, the network would split such that lightweight nodes and full nodes would end up on separate networks, using separate currencies. People using lightweight nodes would be unable to transact with people using full nodes. If all businesses and many users are using full nodes, then this network split is not a critical problem because users of lightweight clients will quickly notice that they can't send or receive bitcoins to/from most of the people who they usually do business with, and so they'll stop using Bitcoin until the evil miners are overcome, which is the appropriate response. However, if almost everyone on the network is using lightweight nodes in this situation, then everyone would continue being able to transact with each other, and so Bitcoin could very well end up 'hijacked' by evil miners.In practice, miners are unlikely to attempt anything like the above scenario as long as full nodes are prevalent because the miners would lose a lot of money. But the incentives completely change if everyone uses lightweight nodes. In that case, miners definitely do have an incentive to change Bitcoin's rules in their favor. It is only reasonably secure to use a lightweight node because most of the Bitcoin economy uses full nodes.Therefore, it is critical for Bitcoin's survival that the great majority of the Bitcoin economy be backed by full nodes, not lightweight nodes. This is especially important for Bitcoin businesses, which have more economic weight. To contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength, you must actually use a full node for your real transactions (or use a lightweight node connected to a full node that you personally control). Just running a full node on a server somewhere does not contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength.More details https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lndPrivacy Downloading the entire blockchain is the most private way to operate a wallet. All other lightweight solutions leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers. The Electrum servers will know which addresses belong to you and can link them together. Despite bloom filtering, SPV nodes based on BitcoinJ do not provide much privacy against nodes who connected directly to the wallet.[1]For some use cases, such privacy may not be required. But an important reason to run a full node and use it as a wallet is to get the full privacy benefits.Security Lightweight nodes are sometimes able to be temporarily tricked into accepting transactions or blocks that are not actually valid. This could cause serious financial damage, especially for websites that automatically process Bitcoin transactions. Full nodes provide the maximum security possible, and so they should be used by all businesses, and also by regular users whenever doing so is convenient.Network services Full nodes may provide various services to other network participants (if the software is run with -listen=1 as is default). This is especially important for lightweight nodes.These services include:Filtering transactions and blocks on behalf of lightweight nodes so that lightweight nodes do not need to download every transaction ever made on the network in order to find their own transactions. Serving historical full blocks to nodes that have been offline for a while. Transmitting new transactions from users to miners. Broadcasting new blocks from miners to other nodes. For the most part, these services are only usefully performed by full nodes that are listening on port 8333. The more full nodes that accept incoming connections there are, the more users the Bitcoin network can support. Although if there is ever a shortage, lots of archival nodes can be easily created by cheaply renting VPS or AWS space.Some are incentivizing it Bitnodes ran a program to incentivize full node operators until the end of 2015.[2]How to run a full node If you run the Bitcoin Core/bitcoind wallet, you are running a full node. If you open port 8333, you will contribute to the network's capacity. If you actually use the wallet feature, or if you use a lightweight client like MultiBit but configure it to connect exclusively to your full node, then you will contribute to the network's economic strength and receive protection from some possible attacks against lightweight nodes.There are a few alternate full node implementations, but they are not recommended for serious use because it is currently difficult to determine whether they implement the consensus rules with 100% accuracy. Even very slight inaccuracies could cause serious problems for the users of these alternate clients.

The main narrative against Bitcoin is: it kills the environment through its massive energy consumption. Simply put.. this could be verifiable if the audience is indoctrinated enough to believe that -an increase in energy consumption= an increase in environmental destruction. I debate that the biggest threat to us thriving as a species on Earth is over development of crucial natural ecosystems. The biggest destroyer of these natural ecosystems is big corporate agendas with linear goals (increase profit) which over develop landscapes to hold their wealth in real estate portfolios. When we look at what gives property value in the current short sited economic situation is location, location, location. Well in order to increase the value of the property within a certain location these corporations must buy up and develop more land in order to continue to store their wealth in real estate (versus just fiat or bonds).People should know that most luxury apartments and in actuality most large buildings in cities.. are.. well.. empty. But owned. They are empty but owned- mostly by corporations or wealthy families storing their wealth in real estate. This is where a store of wealth such as Bitcoin literally can save the earth, while still giving these people a chance to hold their wealth. (Because they won't change, the greed is too deep seeded) Bitcoin acts literally as a microscopic cityscape. So instead of needing to continue to devour natural resources in order to store their worth in tangible material goods (buildings) they can literally store it in the micro version with the same exact effect except that scale wise it doesn't destroy the actual value of life - clean water, thriving natural ecosystems, an abundance of food, and vast healthy land with healthy soil that  grows the foundation of any/all of this existence to even happen.Hopefully you've enjoyed this perspective and can share it with someone that might be inspired.",False,How Bitcoin can help save the Earth from over development:,u/[deleted],0,1,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12erjoc/how_bitcoin_can_help_save_the_earth_from_over/,[]

None of that is actually a given though and it's into the future regarding the technology ('abundance').Bitcoin is seen as being a better form of the gold standard by many but the gold standard wasn't sustainable and Bitcoin would be an even more limiting case.Fractional reserve banking has issues in theory (issues with mass banking runs and in theory even issues with mass repayment of loans) but with government 'back stopping' it actually works pretty well and we've had fractional reserve banking for centuries and it's widespread (everywhere actually).There are a lot of systems that could result in more stability in the long-term including deflation with more savings and then investing and just not having a fractional reserve system and requiring all lending to be backed-up with 100% deposits.They all have their limitations or cons as well. Most books written about Bitcoin seem to either be written by those who present no legitimate criticisms of Bitcoin or they are written by those who are only critical of Bitcoin (cheerleader or hater).I get the issues that Bitcoin is trying to address including the inflation in the current system and the reduced purchasing power of the dollar. It's true that the dollar has reduced purchasing power year by year but it's also true that this is a reason to invest and when you do that there is no reduced purchasing power.

Based on this, I've been thinking that Bitcoin's combined value may not be able to exceed $50 trillion, which would be roughly 2.38 million per Bitcoin (in today's USD equivalent). This is because it seems to me that Bitcoin can only replace liquid money and may not be able to replace assets like real estate, stocks, and other non-liquid forms of wealth.

As its supply is finite and demand continues to rise due to its unique properties, Bitcoin has the potential to become the dominant asset in the global economy.  Bitcoin's fixed supply will absorb market share from all other products/assets on average, causing them to lose value over time due to their higher rates of inflating supply, and less desirable traits for storing wealth.This paper discusses the effects this process may impose on the global economy, potential benefits, problems that could arise, and possible solutions.  It explores the concept of Bitcoin as a store of value becoming a financial black hole, inevitably graduating to its ultimate form; a decentralized and deflationary globally adopted currency - The Bitcoin Singularity.# The Bitcoin Economy - Age of ProsperityInevitable widespread adoption of Bitcoin will lead to a future of abundance and prosperity for consumers by transforming the inflationary economies of today into a long-term global deflationary economy.  As the supply of goods, services, and other assets continue to increase, their prices will decrease relative to Bitcoin's fixed supply, increasing the total market share of Bitcoin over time.As Bitcoin's market share grows, its price denominated in all other assets will also increase, further amplifying the attention it receives due to its unique properties creating a self-reinforcing cycle.  This process naturally incentivizes consumers to save rather than spend.  The shift in consumer behavior will lead to heightened competition among businesses as they strive to create the most beneficial and productive products that remain in demand from a consumer-first perspective.[Bitcoin Economy - Original image by OpenAI's DALL-E 2](https://preview.redd.it/vkuji9zytyra1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14559b0bbde1b94bba3a4256c485e920d5fbe2d8)This heightened competition ensures that only the best products survive in markets, compounding benefits for consumers and promoting *true* economic growth.  In this economy, even governments will have to prioritize their efforts around the interest of consumers in order to earn and retain Bitcoin, if they wish to maintain their power for any significant duration.  Adoption of Bitcoin may create a more equitable and efficient global economy, benefiting all participants.# Mathematical Analysis - Supply( Feel free to skip this section if you are more interested in the story than the supporting equations. ) *'Market Capitalization, or market cap for short, is a measurement of the total value of a given asset. It is calculated using formula (M=PS) where (M)arket cap equals the (P)rice of a single unit of the asset multiplied by the total (S)upply of units in circulation. (P)rice can be solved by rearranging the formula as such; P=M/S.'* I will be Analyzing the mathematics behind how Bitcoin's black-hole effect works through use of the market capitalization formula, and intuitive reproducible examples.  The goal of this analysis is to explore how Bitcoin's value is affected by changes in the supply of other assets.This analysis compares Bitcoin (BTC) to a hypothetical index containing the average value of all assets in existence excluding Bitcoin, using a controlled test environment where demand for both remains stagnant (not growing).  This allows us to observe supply-based effects without any additional factors.The proposed index is similar in concept to Index Funds in the stock market, the (DXY) U.S Dollar Index, or the measure of Bitcoin Dominance over the index of other cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin is denominated by the index. (BTC / Index of All Assets)To facilitate familiarity and understanding, I have chosen to display the units of value in dollars ($), even though dollars (USD) would be included within the index.**Bitcoin Variables:*** bP = $47,619.04  *^(-BTC price)** bM = $1T  *^(-BTC market cap)** bS = 21M  *^(-BTC supply)*bM / bS = bP  =  $1T / 21M = $47,619.04   *^(-Calculated BTC price: $47,619.04)***Index Variables:*** P = $100  *^(-Index price)** M = $100T  *^(-Index market cap)** S = 1T  *^(-Index supply)*M / S = P  =  $100T / 1T = $100  *^(-Calculated index price: $100)*bP / P = (BTC/Index denominated value)  =  $47,619.04 / $100 = $476.1904**Simulation:**'*Let's apply this math to observe what happens when (S)upply of the index increases from 1T to 2T'*M / New S = New P  =  $100T / 2T = $50  *^(-Calculated new index price: $50)*bP / New P = (new denominated value)  =  $47,619.04 / $50 = $952.3808*'The price of the index has dropped by a factor of 2 from $100 to $50, and Bitcoin's index-denominated value has increased by the same factor of 2 from $467.19 to $952.38 respectively (rounded).'*$952.3808 / $476.1904 = 2  *^(-Proof BTC value went up by a factor of 2)*($1T / 21M = $47,619.04) '* 2 = $95,238.08  *^(-Calculated new BTC price: $95,238.08)*$95,238.08 '* 21M = $2T  *^(-Calculated new BTC market cap: $2T)**'The supply increase of the index results in an increase in Bitcoin price and market cap of equal factor.'***Analysis conclusion:**As we can see, Bitcoin's fixed supply ensures its price and market cap are directly corelated with the supply-based performance of other assets, as demonstrated by the simulation.  The increase in the index supply from 1T to 2T resulted in a decrease in the index price from $100 to $50, and an increase in Bitcoin's price from $47,619.04 to $95,238.10, and market cap from $1T to $2T.  This shows that as the supply of other assets increase, Bitcoin's value reacts positively and proportionately.Interestingly, Bitcoin's fixed supply can be seen as a similar constraint as the total (M)oney supply variable when applying the MV=PQ Quantity Theory of Money formula, where the (V)elocity of money, and (Q)uantity of goods and services remain constant.  While this formula is structured differently, the underlying message is similar to the market cap formula in that Bitcoin's fixed supply has a direct impact on its growth in market share as the supply of other assets inflate.It's important to note that demand for bitcoin must remain neutral or positive for this to work, and cannot decline at a rate which would counter these effects.  However, this is not much to ask compared to most or all other assets in the world which do not come with this supply-side advantage.# Potential Concerns & ResolutionsThis section will cover some of the commonly suggested concerns surrounding the idea of the Bitcoin Singularity, and the deflationary economy that would result.**Concern 1:** * Deflationary pressures in the economy may lead to reduced spending and consumption, resulting in hoarding and potential economic slowdown.**Possible resolutions:**1. In a deflationary economy, consumers may only spend on necessary and beneficial products, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources and potentially increasing *true economic growth*.  The assumption that high velocity of money is important may not hold in a long-term deflationary economy given the lack of supporting historical data on the subject. 2. In a deflationary economy, the value of money increases over time, which provides a natural incentive for individuals to save and invest.  This can lead to increased capital formation over time, which in turn can stimulate economic growth in favor of the consumer.3. The development of payment channels and incentivizing spending through rewards or loyalty programs may increase the circulation of Bitcoin. However, the focus should be on promoting spending on productive and valuable goods/services rather than arbitrary spending.**Concern 2:** * The concentration of wealth among early adopters and miners may lead to unequal distribution of resources and power in society.**Possible resolutions:**1. Over time, this issue can naturally be addressed through death & inheritance, spending on necessities and luxuries, and loss of private keys.  These factors will inevitably result in the gradual redistribution of wealth, ensuring a more equitable distribution for all in the long term2. This issue is not unique to deflationary economies, as inflationary currencies also suffer from this problem. Therefore, it is important to recognize that this issue is a common challenge across different types of economies and should be addressed accordingly. 3. It is important to acknowledge that early adopters and miners are entitled to the rewards for taking on the early risk associated with Bitcoin.  Thus, it is not necessary to force them to lose their wealth faster due to inflationary pressures that exist in traditional economies.**Concern 3:*** The decentralized nature of Bitcoin may lead to regulatory challenges and potential conflicts with governments and financial institutions. **Possible resolutions:**1. Governments and financial institutions would be forced to collaborate with consumers to stay relevant in a Bitcoin dominant economy.  As they can no longer print meaningful value, they would have to offer services in alignment with consumers' interests which are capable of earning Bitcoin according to supply and demand.  Failure in this may lead to replacement by an entity more suitable for the role, forcing transparency and democratic collaboration.2. One likely outcome could also be the development of decentralized governance mechanisms enabling decision-making and dispute resolution in a transparent and democratic manner.  This can help ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are represented and society is able to self-regulate in a way that is fair and equitable.**Concern 4:*** If only the most necessary and productive businesses and products can compete in this economy, there may be less jobs, how will consumers earn bitcoin to survive? **Possible resolutions:**1. With the constantly lowering prices of goods and services, consumers would be able to purchase more with the same amount of Bitcoin over time.  This could lead to a higher standard of living for consumers as they can afford to purchase more goods and services. 2. Consumers could earn Bitcoin through various means, such as selling goods or services, mining, or participating in Bitcoin-related activities which generate yield.  Additionally, Bitcoin mining could be integrated into heating systems for homes, and excess computing resources could be utilized during idle time or while playing video games, creating new opportunities for consumers to generate value and earn Bitcoin to both survive and thrive.Although this paper does not cover all the potential issues and respective solutions, it has provided a compelling case that potential concerns have relevant potential solutions.  Further discussions on this topic will be highly appreciated.  It will be interesting to observe how events unfold over time and whether they favor or contradict the presented ideas.# ConclusionBitcoin's unique properties, including its finite supply, decentralized & secure nature, and ability to transfer value without intermediaries, have led to its rapid adoption and growth in value.  This paper has explored the potential effects of Bitcoin's continued growth on the global economy, including the creation of a deflationary economy that could benefit consumers and promote true economic growth.The mathematical analysis presented in this paper demonstrates how Bitcoin's fixed supply leads to an increase in its price and market cap as the supply of other assets increases, providing further evidence for its potential to become the dominant asset in the global economy.While there are potential problems that could arise with the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, such as regulatory challenges and reduced consumer spending, this paper argues that the benefits of a deflationary Bitcoin economy outweigh the potential costs.In conclusion, demand for Bitcoin's unique properties and its fixed supply have the potential to transform the global economy, creating a more equitable and efficient system that benefits all participants. Its continued growth and adoption will be an important area of research and exploration in the coming years.",False,The Bitcoin Singularity - Evolution of the Global Economy,u/[deleted],0,33,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12c58jb/the_bitcoin_singularity_evolution_of_the_global/,[]

If this is the case, I guess I'm fine with it... but I feel like a few things could go wrong:Let's say I have 5 Large shirts, and 10 customers send me bitcoin payments, because they each saw I had a size Large for sale before I could even manually adjust any of the stock levels.How would I verify who to refund? How can I track who is paying for what?

But I wonder how exactly?Here is my thought experiment scenario:* people project the quantum(or other techs) algorithm will break the private keys in the year 2040* bitcoin community agrees with that and devises a plan to upgrade the protocol to support quantum-resistant technology in the year 2030My question: **What will the upgrade look like?**I guess there will be 2 main probable scenarios. (Would love to hear more in the comments)# Scenario 1A soft fork, like what native SegWit does.It introduces a new type of address, which has a different address format, and a different private-key derivation scheme.Old addresses/wallets are still functional. If people want to get the benefits of the new feature, they need to move their funds to the new supported wallets. These new wallets we continue to function like usual.In this case, what will happen to the dead/locked wallets that are not migrated before 2040? Will all those bitcoins be unlocked and dumped into the market? I don't know the exact number but it could be a scarily huge amount of BTC? Or they might want to keep it to themselves and become new bitcoin overlords?Well, do we not need to care since it will only be a one-time event? Or do we need to care because it's an unacceptable attack, and it could happen again and again in the future with different technologies?# Scenario 2A hard fork, like what several others did in the past, given the majority of the Bitcoin network agrees on a consensus to move to the quantum-resistant chainThis way we don't need to worry about locked bitcoins being stolen and dumped into the market.

A bit of context: I'm not an US citizen nor live in the US, I live in developing country in Latin America.I started this journey on April 2021, first time I bought BTC was at '~$58,000 on Binance.I started DCA'ing and trying to figure out ways to pay less fees or get a better price on my BTC purchases. That's when I discovered LocalBitcoins where I would pay 0% fee and sometimes get a price lower than market price.Using LocalBitcoins was a really good option, I know in the US the platform doesn't have a good reputation but in my country most buyers and sellers know each other as the market is not that big. Most of the time is the same people buying and selling, newcomers will appear and get to build their reputation. For me having BTC was like having 'fiat money' in the sense that the market was really liquid I could buy BTC at any time and I could sell my BTC at any time. More liquid than stocks as I'm not from the US for me to buy/sell stocks I have to do a wire transfers and wait couple of days.As you know LocalBitcoins closed on February and so most of us migrated to Paxful. I have to say that Paxful was awful, lots of scammers from other countries, withdrawal issues every day and the volume was low compared to LocalBitcoins. Now Paxful closed today, I was able to get my BTCs out of the platform and on to could storage.Now the objective of this post is to bring awareness that as a person living in a developing country is getting harder and harder for me to cash out my BTC. Don't get my wrong I have a BTC stack that I'm holding for the long term but I also have a stack I use to provide liquidity to the market.The liquidity of my BTCs has been greatly diminished if by any reason I need cash out my BTC I really don't have a reliable option right now. Also there's very few places that accept BTC as a payment method in my country.As the liquidity of BTC has diminished for us most probably than not people will try to sell their BTC as otherwise they will find harder to do so as time goes by.Just wanted to bring awareness to the community about this problem we're running into in developing countries.

I personally do still use bitcoin as a savings account (in self-custody obviously), but not in the hopes that one day I can trade it for more garbage fiat. Instead, I use it to park the products of my labor outside the current corrupt financial system so that it cannot profit off me or control me. Saving in bitcoin also has the advantage that I never have to worry about bank runs, or waking up one day to find that my 'savings' have been confiscated or devalued to zero via inflation or negative interest rates. If the US becomes more totalitarian, I don't have my wealth tied up in real estate that I can't take with me if I have to leave. Yes, the purchasing power of bitcoin varies, but that's why I use a DCA strategy when I buy it.Savings aside, I also use bitcoin to buy things though. I use bitrefill a LOT. I purchase airline tickets,  hotel rooms, groceries, restaurant meals and many other goods/services. Unlike our useless banking system, bitcoin is never closed on the weekends or holidays, and I can always use it on my terms and schedule.

I'm not advocating for anything. This is strictly just information. Feel free to fact check it.How is this relevant? If the dollar does collapse, a whole of people are probably going to wish they had, at the very least, diversified into Bitcoin.Here are my notes (if the formatting is off, give me a few to fix it):# Possible Collapse Of The US Dollar- Note: Most of this comes from Andy Schectman## Timeline- 1944-Bretton Woods Agreement    - Countries would peg their currency to the dollar and the dollar      would be pegged to gold at $35 per oz    - Countries bought dollars with gold- 1971-Nixon suspends the dollar's gold standard    - Concerned that the U.S. was printing more dollars than it had gold      to fund the Vietnam war, the president of France sent a ship full of      cash to buy its gold back    - This sparked Nixon to suspend the gold standard **temporarily**    - The gold standard is still suspended- 1974-Henry Kissinger brokers a joint military cooperation agreement  with Saudi Arabia for military protection in exchange for OPEC valuing  oil in dollars globally    - Since this deal, almost every country has had to own dollars in order      to buy oil    - Hence 'petrodollar'- 2017-German Bundesbank repatriates its gold back from US    - This was at the end of a six-year precious metals bear market    - This was a really weird move    - Within a few weeks of this, the banks of Austria, Hungary, Turkey,      Czech National Bank, Dutch National Bank, followed in kind- 2018-The same group that repatriated their gold bought more gold as a  group than the 60 previous years combined- 2019-The previous numbers from 2018 are up nearly 100%- 2019-Bank of International Settlements *quietly* reclassified gold as the  world's only other tier 1 asset    - Since 1944, only US dollars and treasuries were tier 1 assets    - Gold was tier 3 which meant only 50% was valued on the balance-sheet      and became tier 1 which made it equal to cash    - Were these banks clued in by the BIS?- 2020-China's Belt and Road Initiative    - Represents over 75% of the world population    - 45% of global GDP, even before it's industrialized    - Contracts are mostly settled in the digital yuan- 2020-International Monetary Fund (IMF) says they want a 'New Bretton       Woods'- 2020-Commitment of Traders Report from COMEX    - Typically only commercial banks and speculators    - Now there is a new list of reportables called the 'others' which are      family offices and sovereign wealth funds who are considered the      most well-informed private investors    - '... to this point in my career, less than 1% of COMEX contracts      ever stood for delivery,' - Andy Schectman    - The 'others' drained the market of physical supply    - In 2020, took off more silver than in a typical decade and more      gold than the Bank of Japan has in its official holdings- 2021-Russia, Turkey, India, Poland, China, Kazakhstan, Hungary, Thailand,  Japan, Brazil, Czech Republic all copiously accumulating gold    - Not just buying gold, but buying and taking *delivery* of it- 2021-One day after America 'surrenders' Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and  Russia announce a joint military cooperation agreement    - The same type of agreement that Kissinger brokered with Saudi Arabia      in 1974 that started the petrodollar- 2021-The very next day, Nigeria announces the same agreement between them  and Russia    - Nigeria is currently selling their oil to China for Yuan denominated      bonds that can be converted to gold immediately on the Shanghai Gold      Exchange    - Called the petro-yuan bond    - This is how countries can side-step U.S. sanctions    - (Saudi Arabia is now doing this too)- 2022-U.S. weaponized the dollar against Russia using SWIFT    - America told one country that they can no longer freely use the      global reserve currency    - Russia is pushed into the open arms of China    - Were other countries, including the [BRICS](#brics-nations) nations,      wondering if they were or could be next?- 2022-Russian, Iran, India corridor    -

New Bitcoin only comes into existence after miners complete a proof of work challenge (which requires real time, power, and opportunity cost). Therefore, each new Bitcoin is imbued with inherent chronoconomic value since time must be spent before any Bitcoin are minted. As a result, accepting Bitcoin in exchange for labor is justified: the time spent earning Bitcoin is fairly exchanged for the time spent minting that Bitcoin.   **Bitcoin chronoconomics are balanced: Minting Labor ‚âà Wage Labor**  Contrast this to fiat. Fiat is minted without an expenditure of human time. As a result, accepting fiat in exchange for labor is not justified: the time spent earning fiat is not fairly exchanged against the lack of time needed to mint new fiat.  **Fiat chronoconomics are imbalanced: Minting Labor < Wage Labor**   # Bitcoin's Pure and Transparent Chronoconomics Further, **the chronoconomics of Bitcoin are pure, simple, and transparent**. There is no layer between the proof of work and the resulting Bitcoin. When someone solves the hash for a given block, new Bitcoin are minted into existence. Since each Bitcoin is tied to a private key which is unforgeable, this means that if you see a Bitcoin, you know exactly what value it has. The chronoconomics are justifiable.   # Chronoconomic InvestmentingBitcoin's chronoconomics make for a highly attractive investment. Unlike stocks, where investors rely on complex financial reports, market sentiment, and competitor analysis to determine value, the value of Bitcoin is directly linked to the hashrate. **The hashrate is a measure of the chronoconomic time value that miners dedicate to securing the Bitcoin network** (since hash rate ‚âà time'*). As a result, the current value of Bitcoin is easily observable, being proportional to the hash rate accumulated into the blockchain thus far [1](https://www.bitrawr.com/terminal/hashrate-vs-price). In terms of forward-looking valuation, Bitcoin's predictable scarcity incentivizes hash rate to keep increasing, reliably increasing Bitcoin's chronoconomic density (the time value stored within each Bitcoin), reliably causing a price increase (number go up)! [2](https://youtu.be/kxdLy-ByHpY?t=476)   '* Only roughly, as increases in compute efficiency, capture of stranded energy, debt from public btc miners, cycles, and more prevent anything near 1:1. # Comparing Chronoconomics to Tokenomics As a reminder, chronoconomics is a measure of the time value stored in a given token. **Since time is money, and money is energy, and energy is valuable, then the more time (or chronoconomic density), the more value.** Chronoconomics is similar to tokenomics (which measures a token's supply, distribution, minting process, etc), but focused solely on a token's time value. Note that most other tokens have little to no chronoconomic value, instead relying on more esoteric sources of value (such as trying to solve problems in novel ways, like a business). The value of Bitcoin, on the other hand, lies mostly in chronoconomic density increasing over time.   # The Historic Significance of Gold's Chronoconomics On a historic note, gold was also selected for its chronoconomic value. Since gold is rare, difficult to mine, and difficult to refine, it also had built in proof of work ‚Äì inherent chronoconomic value. It came into the marketplace only after gold miners spent incredible time mining and minting. That time expenditure justified gold's exchange for labor and goods. But sadly for our favorite shiny rock, gold's numerous shortcomings led it to its eventual demise [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coHC_9ApBdg).   Bitcoin might not be a shiny rock, but its chronoconomic clarity and lack of defect is a shining light in an otherwise opaque investment landscape.   **In conclusion, I'm all in.** &#x200B;&#x200B;Note: These ideas aren't really new, but I thought the word 'chronoconomic' was a good way to conceptualize what might be otherwise thought of as many different things, when really it's all one thing. .",False,Chronoconomics: Bitcoin's Greatest Feature,u/[deleted],0,6,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12b29vr/chronoconomics_bitcoins_greatest_feature/,[]

Rather, I will attempt to provide a general example of how I approach comparing assets to Bitcoin with the goal of wealth preservation and growth.# The ExperimentWhether you are comparing Gold, Silver, real estate, stocks, FIAT(USD), altcoins, or anything else,  Perform a deep thought experiment weighing each of their properties against the properties of Bitcoin. From there, objectively think about the how the future will develop around the properties being compared. Focus on the properties of the asset and whether or not they support your goals.**For Example...**I will be using gold in this example as I am familiar with its properties and it is commonly debated in regard to whether or not it is better than Bitcoin. However, you can apply this to other assets as well:**Step 1. Consider Supply**Gold inflates in supply (roughly 2%/year) due to mining, and there is no guaranteed cap to the supply on gold. There could be infinite gold within the universe, and one day nuclear reactions could be used to create gold (This is how gold is naturally formed within the universe). Gold will still likely be an incredibly slow supply-growth asset, and will likely perform well compared to other faster growing in supply assets.Bitcoin outpaces gold in its supply model by comparison. Bitcoin is hard-coded finite in supply and this cannot change, giving it more value gaining potential. A guaranteed fixed supply ensures that bitcoin will go up in value over time as long as demand remains constant or goes up against gold.(Even if demand for both gold and bitcoin were to remain stagnant, the increase in gold supply over time will reduce its value relative to bitcoin's fixed supply, leading to a direct increase in the value of bitcoin over gold at the same rate.)**Step 2. Safety & Security**Throughout history, gold has consistently been easily confiscated through violence, war and decree due to its physicality. See executive order 6102, where the US government ordered the ban of holding physical gold and for citizens to deliver their gold to government reserves in exchange for pieces of paper.[Headline of Executive Order 6102](https://preview.redd.it/plnuq5qziora1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb8a67f5949a3caf86beb4a508ea99563d52f430)If you currently 'own' any gold, similar to how bitcoiners say 'not your keys not your coins', the same can be said for gold. If you cannot physically hold the gold in your hand, it isn't your gold. You are trusting a 3rd party and taking on counter-party risk.Even if you do own physical gold, you now have to find a safe place to store it, and is more susceptible to theft. Where bitcoin takes little to zero physical storage space. (Keys can even be stored within your memory.)The only way to take bitcoin through violent means, would be to take you in for interrogation and attempt to force you to willingly give up your keys. This means bitcoin would be far more expensive and time consuming for governments or criminals to get hold of your bitcoin contrast to far less effort in stealing gold.(Imagine the increase in difficulty if they tried to enforce a similar order to 6102 on bitcoin)**Step 3. Price Potential***'Market Capitilization, or market cap for short, is a measurement of the total value of a given asset. It is calculated using formula (PS=M) where (M)arket cap equals the (P)rice of a single unit of the asset multiplied by the total (S)upply of units in circulation. (P)rice can be solved by rearranging the formula as such; P=M/S'*The market cap of gold is roughly $13T as of writing this post and $500B for Bitcoin. Assets with higher market cap's require higher inflows of value to push prices further. As bitcoin is still relatively new compared to gold and many other assets, especially with its recent pullbacks, it has much higher potential upside.It is important to keep in mind that an asset's market cap being low, isn't always an indicator of its true price potential, as some assets simply do not have the fundamentals to ever grow beyond a certain market cap. The best way to use this metric is to compare fundamentally similar assets together by their market caps, as the difference between them indicates their market cap growth potential.For example; if you think bitcoin can compete with Gold's use-case it is reasonable to anticipate that Bitcoin could achieve a market cap of $13T similar to gold. If this happened, bitcoin's price would become: M/S = P or $13T/21M = $619,047.62 (26x increase).  For gold to increase by 26x it would require achieving a market cap of $338T, which requires much greater inflow of value to achieve compared to bitcoin. (This also assumes gold supply remains constant, which it wouldn't)**Step 4. Demand**Well, I don't know about you, but after I got done writing the previous 3 steps, I went ahead and picked up some more bitcoin.Demand often comes as a result of an Asset's properties' allowing it to perform according to ones goals absent of better alternatives. Similar to properties in any system, if a system has properties suitable to solving a problem, people who have that problem are more likely to use it.If bitcoins unique properties seem to you like they would be desirable by others to achieve their goals, there will be demand. Plain and Simple.Another interesting point on the topic of demand of bitcoin vs gold specifically, is through analyzing market participants. (Who will be buying?)Gold is more renowned by older generations, while bitcoin is likely to be embraced by up and coming generations.  Take Peter Schiff as an example.  He loves gold and recommends buying it to this day while recommending against bitcoin.  His son on the other hand, is a big bitcoin proponent.Also consider when Peter Schiff bought his gold... Likely years ago, when it was at a much lower price. Think about how many generations of gold buyers there have been who have done very well and are going to be using their profits to afford their retirement.  Imagine buying gold when it was only $37 in 1971.  This could be what buying Bitcoin now will feel like going forward.**Step 5. Repeat**Perform this same exercise covering each point with all other assets you are considering according to your goals. Feel free to add in as many additional steps you can think of as well, as it will increase the resolution of your decision making and understanding of each product. This guide is meant as a brief example for readers to learn how to begin their approach in comparing assets to form solid decisions. (not all-encompassing)# ConclusionWhat I objectively found through this process is that bitcoin pretty much wins across the board in all aspects from true ownership, supply, security, transferability, flexibility, and the fact that it still is quite low in mkt cap compared to alternatives (higher upside potential).Overall in my mind, Bitcoin will likely continue growing in value over time naturally through its guaranteed fixed supply, and demand for its unique properties which set it in a league of its own. This is my current personal conclusion based on running these thought experiments against every other alternative asset I could think of. Consider performing similar analysis for your own decisions, as it may help you achieve greater understanding of the objects you are putting your hard earned money into.I think its also important to take some time to understand how Market Capitalization mathematics work as it is a useful formula for understanding supply metrics and price potential through comparison of asset market caps.As all other assets inflate/increase in supply on average over time, their prices will go down relative to bitcoin whose supply remains constant, even if bitcoin's demand flatlines. (bonus if bitcoin demand goes up)This is math - The Choice is yours.",False,Should I Buy Bitcoin? - Important Thought Experiment and Guide!,u/[deleted],0,8,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12anxzf/should_i_buy_bitcoin_important_thought_experiment/,[]

They had hacked banks, governments, corporations, and celebrities, leaking their data and demanding ransom. They had also hacked other hackers, stealing their tools and techniques. They were feared and respected in the dark web, and no one knew their true identities or motives.One day, they decided to take on their biggest challenge yet: hacking bitcoin. They had heard of the cryptocurrency's popularity and value, and they wanted to test its security and maybe make some money along the way. They thought it would be easy to hack into the network and manipulate the transactions, or at least find some vulnerabilities that they could exploit.They spent months researching and planning their attack. They gathered information about the bitcoin protocol, the nodes, the miners, the wallets, and the exchanges. They rented a powerful botnet to launch a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on the network. They also created fake transactions and broadcasted them to the network, hoping to confuse the nodes and double-spend their coins.However, they soon realized that their attack was futile. The bitcoin network was too resilient and robust to be affected by their DDoS attack. The nodes quickly rejected their fake transactions and validated the real ones. The miners continued to secure the network and produce new blocks. The wallets and exchanges detected their attempts to steal or scam their users and blocked them.The Chaos Crew was stunned and frustrated. They had never encountered such a strong and decentralized system before. They tried different methods and angles, but none of them worked. They started to lose interest and resources, and some of them even quit the group.But some of them were intrigued by bitcoin. They wanted to understand how it worked and why it was so secure. They started to study the code and the design of bitcoin more closely. They learned about cryptography, consensus algorithms, game theory, economics, and philosophy. They realized that bitcoin was not just a technology, but a social movement. It was a way to create a fairer and freer world, where people could control their own money and data without intermediaries or authorities.They began to appreciate and admire bitcoin. They saw its potential and value, not only as a currency, but as a platform for innovation and change. They decided to stop hacking bitcoin and start using it instead. They created their own wallets and bought some bitcoins from reputable sources. They also joined some online communities and forums where they could learn more and contribute to the development of bitcoin.They changed their name from the Chaos Crew to the Bitcoiners.

The big dip on the red line is when hash-rates fell due to china banning bitcoin mining back in 2021. Look how much its recovered. Wow.This is actually pretty nuts, because one of the aspects in how bitcoin works, is to do with the relationship between Bitcoin price, and its hash-rate. As hash-rates go up, it becomes literally harder to mine bitcoin due to the difficulty adjustment, making it cost more money to mine from an energy and equipment input perspective.When Bitcoin prices are low, it also means that the rewards received from mining are lower in total value than normal. The fact hash-rates are up way higher than they were during the recent bull-market peak prices even despite the china ban in 2021, is actually quite astonishing.What do you guys think this means for Bitcoin?&#x200B;Chart provided by YouTube channel [Invest Answers](https://www.youtube.com/live/PMOCIMhwWFE?feature=share).",False,Bitcoin Hash-Rates at All Time Highs - What does this imply?,u/[deleted],0,18,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12a7il6/bitcoin_hashrates_at_all_time_highs_what_does/,[]

You're on your own for those costs.I understand that all of this is a bit hyperbole. However, the threat remains that one power over monetary data is horrifying.

If you're someone who doesn't like 'fud' and might feel personally attacked by the criticism of Bitcoin and Bitcoiners then I suggest you skip this post and click something else. Have a nice day.Imagine a poker table at an illegal gambling hall. There are 10 players. Each gambler has to spend $1K that night. At the end of the night there will be winners and losers. Everyone who will go home with a profit will have directly or indirectly taken it from someone who lost. There was a total of $10K at the start of the night and the 10 players together combined will leave with a total of $10K. That money just got shuffled around through poker producing winners and losers.Now imagine the same scenario but players can join the game and leave after each round and the game never ends. In terms of being zero sum, not much has changed. For someone who walks away a winner, there is someone else who had to walk away or will eventually walk away a loser. All the realised profits in this game come at the expense of other gamblers. It's impossible for everyone who plays the game to walk away a winner. The money is just getting shuffled around between players. No new money is getting added to system outside of the players in the game.Now lets think about the Bitcoin market. How is it all that different? All realised profits you make in Bitcoin come from other 'investors'/speculators who are also most likely buying it in the hopes of making a profit.It's a zero sum game and also relies on the concept of 'greater fools'. In some ways it's just a long game of hot potato. You buy Bitcoin in the hopes of selling it at a higher price to some other guy who's also likely buying it because he wants to sell it to someone else at a higher price. Every fool who buys Bitcoin, does it in the hopes of dumping it on the head of an even greater fool ad infinitum.The main takeaway here is that all realised profits generated in Bitcoin only come from other 'investors'/speculators in the market.In ponzi schemes there is usually a guaranteed expectation of profits and the same can be said about Bitcoin: 'if you're just patient and just hold long enough'. In financial markets there's a phrase - 'Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results' but somehow Bitcoiners will always use past price action to justify why number will always go up. 'Just look at Bitcoin from Date X to Y/ Best Performing Asset since Y/ Bitcoin has number go up technology etc. 'Since there's no real way to argue away the fact that all realised profits in Bitcoin come from other investors and speculators. **I've found that Bitcoiners frequently respond with this line of argument:  'No it's not zero sum/a greater fool/ a headless ponzi because...(lists some unrelated property of Bitcoin)'**How will you know if you're also using this line of reasoning? If your response is going to sound something like this: 'Elephants aren't mammals because they have 2 tusks, a trunk and can be used to transport heavy goods!'Nevertheless, I will still try to briefly touch on some of the points you guys might raise.# 'But I'm never going to to sell my Bitcoin, I'm going to exchange it for other assets, goods or services'If the person accepting your Bitcoin isn't a fool, then he will most likely have to convert that Bitcoin immediately to Fiat to avoid volatility risk. Who will he sell it to? A speculator. A greater fool.And if the person who received your Bitcoin decides to hodl a volatile asset like Bitcoin, well then what does that make him? A speculator and another greater fool.If you're now going to start telling me about your Hyperbitcoinization fantasy and how everything will be priced in sats. Well, what is it that you're doing right now? You're speculating! You're just another speculator playing in this game of speculators and greater fools.Gamblers, Speculators and Greater Fools seem to be an inherent aspect of the life cycle of Bitcoin transactions and can't be avoided or escaped.# 'But I don't buy Bitcoin for the price increase/ the price isn't important to me'Bitcoiners will often lie and claim 'Bitcoin isn't about the price/the price is just noise'. The security model of Bitcoin itself is dependent on the price! As Bitcoiners themselves like to say 'It's secure because it's valuable and it's valuable because it's secure'.And tell me why anyone would buy it if there wasn't an expectation of number go up? Would you buy Bitcoin if it was only ever expected to go down in price? Of course not!When I complain about the volatility of Bitcoin. I've been told Bitcoin needs to get to a market cap of 10T (mktcp of gold) and then the prices wil stabilize. Like literally the first step of Bitcoin becoming a globally adopted currency to become stable enough to be used in business and finance is dependent on number go up (which has to be done by ponzi-ing it up to 10T). So let's stop with the bullshit about Bitcoin isn't about the price going up. Ok?# 'The Price of Bitcoin will always go up because of it's scarcity'Some might argue that Bitcoin 'scarcity' is what will make number go up. Without demand scarcity doesn't mean shit. And Bitcoin really isn't even all that scarce tbh, with 2.1 Quadrillion sats as the total supply. The demand for Bitcoin really comes from cultish narratives about Bitcoin.Bitcoiners evangelizing aka 'orange pilling' people about things like* freedom money* hard money* guvmint bad* fed bad* central banks evil* inflation is theft* bitcoin is an inflation hedge* bitcoin is digital gold* bitcoin is protection from monetary debasement* bicoin is self sovereignty* bitcoin is hope* bitcoin will save you* bitcoin protects purchasing power* bitcoin gives you property rights* bitcoin is the goddess of wisdom protected by cyberhornets* and even other quasi religious narratives about bitcoin being the last hope and saviour from the evils of the fiat systemBitcoiners feel like they belong to a special group (the 21m club) they feel like they're part of a community, that they're part of something greater. I would honestly love to go into more detail about Bitcoins cultishness but I don't want to stray too far away from the main topic of Bitcoin being zero sum and a greater fool asset. Before you get upset at me for characterizing Bitcoin as culty, ask yourself whether Bitcoiners themselves behave like a normal community with a common interest or more like religious zealots.My main point here is that the demand is coming from narratives and myth-making. **The price appreciation of Bitcoin isn't coming from some special property of Bitcoin but from narratives. Bitcoin is a narrative driven asset.**# 'But Bitcoin is just like other investment assets like Real Estate, Precious metals, stocks etc.'An investment in Bitcoin is much different from a stock or other types of investments and purchases as I'll explain below:**When I invest in a stock of a company** Then that company is presumably engaged in economically productive activities which make money/create profits/generate revenue etc. That company can then share those profits with it's shareholders by issuing dividends or doing stock buybacks or just growing the business and increasing the cash flow/profits and overall valuation of the company which can then result in a higher share price. It isn't zero sum game because the money isn't only coming from other investors but also from the company's profits.**When I invest in Real Estate** I can actually live there. I can rent it. I can use it for business to generate even more income. I can even use my real estate as collateral to secure a loan. Even without a greater fool to sell it to - it still has a purpose.**When I buy a car** I can use that car to get to work to make money. I can do deliveries or uber to make money. I can live in the car. I can rent my car.  I can race for money if I want. I can soup up my car and sell it at a higher price. I can do all kinds of things with my car without having to sell it to someone else.**When I buy Gold** That gold can be used in electronics, jewelry, industrial uses and even in some medical uses like dentistry etc. I  can even lend gold jewelry or use the Gold as collateral. Hell, I can even use it as a weapon and throw a gold bar in someone's face to defend myself. Gold is useful without it's only use being to sell it to someone else.**When I buy Bitcoin** I get an entry in a decentralized append-only ledger which is secured by cryptography and a shitload of energy and it also has a fixed issuance schedule/supply. It updates globally roughly every 10 minutes and you can send units from one address to another, peer to peer without intermediaries. That's it?# 'None of what you said matters because Bitcoin is actually money/a currency/ an inflation hedge etc.'No it isn't any of those things despite how often you keep repeating it. Those aren't facts, they're literally just narratives.Bitcoin isn't a currency, it isn't a medium of exchange, it isn't a reliable store of value, it isn't an inflation hedge. The reality is that it's a volatile and speculative greater fool asset.Weirdo libertarians can keep pretending that volatile and speculative assets are somehow good at being money but they really aren't. Honestly, I'm actually ok with it being called 'an ongoing monetary experiment' or something like that, but please stop pretending like it's currently a good medium of exchange or a reliable store of value or even a good form of money. You might as well be arguing that the Earth is flat or that the sun isn't a star. If you're going to tell me how one day in the future it will be the best money ever. Ok good, so then call it money in the future when it actually is money, please don't do it right now because it's obviously an outright lie.Let's not pretend Bitcoin hasn't had 50-80% crashes before and that it didn't just crash from 69K to 15K in recent times. Bitcoin behaves like a speculative risk-on asset according to the free-market - which you guys love so much. While the price of groceries and other household goods was steadily rising - Bitcoin was crashing. Bitcoin has no direct correlation to inflation. In recent times when the PCE goes down, Bitcoins price jumps in response. If you actually want to an asset that has a direct correlation to inflation: Inflation linked bonds are an asset that are linked to inflation. Bitcoin only has a narrative link to inflation. And besides - you guys should lying - you guys don't actually want an inflation hedge. You want to do a 10x or a 100x. Which is fine. But stop lying about the whole inflation hedge thing because its a claim with extremely loose and vague time parameters and in reality Bitcoin has no causal link to inflation.# 'But what about...(some other thing or system)'One of the main arguments of Bitcoiners are usually some kind of whataboutism, and pointing out how other things and systems are flawed to make Bitcoin look better because Bitcoin can't stand on it's own merits. Its always the usual thing with bitcoiners with them giving  examples of extreme and fringe cases about authoritarian regimes with strict capital controls, political dissidents, assets seizures, bank freezes, crossing borders, double digit inflation in corrupt dictatorships  (how pathetic was Bitcoin then, after all that money printing, that it crashed from 69K to 15K and the dollar/stablecoins was actually a better asset for them to hold than Bitcoin! ü§£) and so on.# 'You don't understand! You just don't get it'If you're going to say 'you just don't understand' or 'you just don't get it'. It's because there isn't a rational and convincing explanation for any of your beliefs.Oh and please don't waste my time expecting me to  read or listen to the views of the climate change deniers and bitcoin maxis like Saifedean or any of those other Bitcoin pumpers and maxis like Michael Saylor, Matthew Kratter, Max Keiser, Anthony Pompliano, Cory Klippsten,  Pete Mccormack, Robert Breedlove and others.When you say these things it really sounds like you can't even properly explain or defend your views without saying 'just read these books' or 'watch these videos and podcasts'. It sounds like you just blindly accepted someone else's views without any critical thought at all.TLDRTo sum up my views:* Bitcoin IS zero sum game/a greater fool asset.* All realised profits in Bitcoin come from other investors/speculators* Bitcoin has no use without greater fools* The security model of Bitcoin itself is dependent on Greater Fools* Bitcoin isn't money. You can call a horse a cat all you want, it isn't going to meow* Bitcoin isn't a currency* Bitcoin is volatile and speculative.* Bitcoin isn't an inflation hedge or a store of value. It's a risk-on asset.* Bitcoin is a narrative driven asset* Bitcoiners love to use really bad arguments like whataboutism and shitting on everything else to make Bitcoin look better* Bitcoiners use extreme fringe cases about authoritarian regimes with capital controls, political dissidents, bank account freezes etc. to justify their headless ponzi assets existence.* Bitcoiners are super culty.I elaborated why I think this way in the post above.Let me know your thoughts.#Edit: Seems like my comments keep getting deleted.

Chapter 8: Digital Assets: Relearning Economic Principles--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This chapter begins with how multiple financial cries had happened in the US but it seem to suggest that most of them are being caused by unregulated bank-like functioned entities namely trust funds. They claimed those crisis have lead to the creation of FED which control creation of dollar bill manufacturing annd monetary policies. They suggest that previous crisis namely 1907 and so on (we all know its 2008), had lead to the creation of decentralized financial system. The Perceived Appeal of Crypto Assets-------------------------------------------------------------- (They listed the appeal of crypto assets here and debunked these with next section)Claim: Crypto Assets Could Be Investment Vehicles (They suggest by hoping for profit or hedge against inflation in the future, crypto could be investment vehicles just like stocks and bonds)Claim: Cryptocurrencies Could Offer Money-like Functions without Relying on a Single Authority (They described how censorship-resistant financial system is built with the aim of decentralized entity with decentralized contribution to issue representation of value to replace centralized financial system)Claim: Crypto Assets Could Enable Fast Digital Payments(They described how the usage of cash notes has been declining and digital payments are in demand and widely used. They said crypto industry claimed that stable coins could be used as faster digital payments due to their peg to US Dollar. )Claim: Crypto Assets Could Increase Financial Inclusion(They said crypto industry claimed that they can bank the unbank giving crypto has no overdraft or minimum deposit to get started and suggested with a report finding that minority households are more likely to be invested in crypto). Claim: Crypto Assets Could Improve the United States' Current Financial Technology Infrastructure(They said that crypto industry claimed that by using DLT and smart contracts technologies, US could improve its current technology infrastructure )The Reality of Crypto Assets----------------------------------------------(This is where they counter or argue above facts). Crypto Assets Are Mostly Speculative Investment Vehicles(They suggest that crypto are very volatile and suitable for short-term trading, and the volatility is because crypto has no fundamental values unlike stocks. They said bitcoin aimed to function as inflation hedge but as inflation rises, bitcoin prices has collapsed thus further proving that they are speculative, volatile and has no fundamental value). Cryptocurrencies Generally Do Not Perform All the Functions of Money as Effectively as Sovereign Money, such as the U.S. Dollar(They explained the functions  of money which are _ unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. They claimed even though cryptocurrencies perform those above functions, its only in limited ways.They claimed that crypto functions are not _ effective unit of account, effective medium of exchange, and effective store of value.)** They sneak in the section of crypto mining and how it is risking the environment. Touche. Stablecoins Can Be Subject to Run Risk(They claimed how much risk to being run in stable coins here but strangely support DLT technology and suggest that it could be use as a effective technology for payment or settlement system)Crypto Assets Can Be Harmful to Consumers and Investors(They said how crypto industry is un-regulated , not investor protected and basically operating in unlawful manners. They said the entities  has basically scammed a lot of users. They mentioned that they could be conflict of interest of crypto-platforms as most of the platforms offer exchage, broker, market making and clearing agency function.They said these integration of services are not allowed in tradtional financial system due to them leading to cosumer risks. They detailed the whole of how FTX has scammed the users  )There Have Been Limited Economic Benefits from DLT Technology(They discussed how DLT is being viewed as novel , they are not suitable for every applications. They described how prominent programmers / developers has shown their unlikeness in DLT being used in applications. They suggest that alternatives to DLT in monetary applications are far better. They suggest that DLT based Blockchains are relying on Miners which are harming the environment. They claimed that blockchain does not remove the trust layer but simply shifting the trust layer from person / organization to technology along with the features and bugs. Due to uselessness for application , web3 is shifting to some sort of centralization but in disguise of blockchain technolgy due to east of control . as they quote 'once a distributed ecosystem centralizes around a platform for convenience, it becomes the worst of both worlds: centralized control, but still distributed enough to become mired in time'.   )Other Risks from Crypto Assets(They stated that leverage, and ransomware and price volatility are other risks of crypto assets with details of ransomware being paid with crypto alongside with ransomware lists by countries and the cost of ransomware in 2020.   )** Here comes no surprises ** Investing in the Nation's Digital Financial Infrastructure(They highlighted the use cases and details of The FedNow Instant Payment System and CBDC summarized with the quote of 'According to these objectives, the U.S. CBDC system, if implemented, should protect consumers, promote economic growth, improve payment systems, provide interoperability with other platforms, advance financial inclusion, protect national security, respect human rights, and align with democratic values.')",False,Crypto Debunked by US : I read US President Economic Report 2023 so that you don't have to .,u/[deleted],0,10,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/129sjmm/crypto_debunked_by_us_i_read_us_president/,[]

And Bitcoin (or any other crypto) only has the value it has because people are choosing to hold it.   ALL VALUE is the collective subjective opinion of all marketplace participants (ie. people).  And people can change their minds quickly.Governments and especially 'government officials' have forgotten this because their monopoly on the use of physical violence over the last century became so great that they could afford to believe their own lie...  until the free market invented something that (when stored correctly) could not be taken away by physical violence;)It is also why Bitcoin is so desperately needed.

That already starts to fade away it's almost impossible to compete nowadays with the huge miners out there.Now think of an unlikely scenario of a hyper inflation. Who will sell their bitcoin if everyone only wants to *use* it? And nobody wants to sell for a high inflating currency? This is a constant fear I'm living in for almost a decade now since my first Bitcoin. I'm scared of selling. I'm scared that I wake up one day and it will be impossible to get Bitcoins because the demand sky rocketed overnight.Once you have a larger amount of fiat you realize how easy it is to make fiat with fiat but how hard it is to make bitcoin with bitcoin. The difference between soft & hard money.  We are still very early. I don't know how long it takes it might be decades but you have already seen what a little hype can do to BTC value in USD in 2020-2021. Inflation doesn't go away. Things don't get cheaper - only more expensive.

With more and more institutional investors getting involved, and the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency in mainstream society, the future looks bright for Bitcoin.So, what are some of the trends we should be keeping an eye on in the coming year? Here are a few predictions:Increased Adoption: We're already seeing more businesses accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, but this trend is set to continue in 2023. As more people become familiar with Bitcoin and its benefits, we can expect to see a surge in adoption rates.Regulatory Changes: Governments around the world are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. In 2023, we can expect to see more concrete regulations put in place, which will provide more clarity and stability for the Bitcoin market.Bitcoin as a Safe Haven: With political and economic uncertainty on the rise, more people are turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. As this trend continues, we can expect to see the value of Bitcoin increase.Enhanced Security: With the increasing value of Bitcoin comes an increased need for security. In 2023, we can expect to see more advanced security measures put in place, which will help protect Bitcoin holders from hacking and other forms of theft.Scalability Improvements: As more people use Bitcoin, the need for scalability becomes more pressing. In 2023, we can expect to see improvements in the scalability of the Bitcoin network, which will make it easier to use and more efficient.These are just a few of the trends to watch in 2023.

Competition among businesses will skyrocket, and a focus on delivering services to consumers a priority.  Bitcoin's deflationary model ensures that everything naturally decreases in value compared to Bitcoin over time, contrast to every other inflationary currency, including FIAT & gold.This singularity blackhole-like effect will lead to a Bitcoin economy.  Where people are less likely to spend and more likely to save, driving businesses to compete for the most productive/desirable products and services.  This competition ensures higher quality goods, better decision-making, and compounding lower prices.  Even governments will be forced to act in the best interest of the consumer, forced into an endless quest of finding productive means to continuously earn Bitcoin if they hope to remain in power.# The ProblemIt is important to note that while Bitcoin is overall disinflationary, it still undergoes inflationary periods due to its current mining reward subsidy schedule.  Bitcoin's rate of inflation slows over time through its halving cycles, but it is still technically inflationary until all remaining Bitcoin have been mined over the next 120 years.For the Bitcoin economy to succeed as described, Bitcoin needs to transition from its current inflationary model to its deflationary end-state without failure. Without this transition, Bitcoin risks losing its most valuable quality; the promise of true digital scarcity.Bitcoin's security model relies on its mining network, where the higher total mining hash-rate performed through honest miners, the higher entry cost barrier for bad actors to be able to perform attacks. This security model is currently sustained through the built-in incentive mechanism allowing miners to earn Bitcoin as a reward for contributing to the total hash-rate. However, once all Bitcoin have been mined, the only reward will be transaction fees. The question is; will these fees be sufficient to incentivize miners to maintain the network's security long-term?In light of this concern, it is crucial to explore potential solutions to ensure a smooth transition from the current inflationary model to a truly deflationary one, while maintaining the security and integrity of the network.# Will Bitcoin Succeed?A few years ago, there was an article written on this topic by Dan Held called [Bitcoin's Security is Fine](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8).The article outlines a forecasted transaction fee model predicting that fees would increase over time. The purpose of this was to display a potential reduced need for mining more Bitcoin to reward miners sufficiently, and that transaction fees would suffice over time. The chart used in the article was created by [Awe'_andWonder](https://twitter.com/Awe_andWonder), but the Twitter account has since been removed.[Awe'_andWonder's chart forecasting tx fees to increase over time.](https://preview.redd.it/xq7gkhoq2yqa1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a7980fef8ebdc8304b295764b93ae56d491888d1)If you are like me, you will notice that this is a forecasted assumption made in 2019, and not something that is guaranteed. Upon seeing this chart, I wondered how it looks today in 2023.  Thanks to CoinMarketCap's recently released [Deep Dive video](https://youtu.be/8si1gB8siTA) on the topic, I was able to find this information.[Recreation of Crossover Point. We can see fees are not going up as anticipated.](https://preview.redd.it/smp4agxy3yqa1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af55a04d1d2e2c76ebacc2778da7aa2a266d5712)As of 2023, we can see that fees are not moving as originally forecasted, and are in fact lower than they have been since 2011 even though adoption has been growing consistently so far. Lower transaction fees are beneficial for making Bitcoin transactions more scalable. However, this lowering of fees pose a potential threat to Bitcoin's security model. If fees are not sufficient to reward miners, they may have to shut down their equipment due to costs of business. This could lead to lower hash rates from honest miners and a decrease in mining difficulty scaling. This could make it more cost-effective for opportunistic bad actors to attempt 51% attacks.Furthermore, the way Bitcoin's halving cycles work may inherently be flawed. As fewer Bitcoin are available to reward miners, a gradual decrease in number of willing mining participants could occur over time. This issue may be resolved naturally if Bitcoin's price roughly doubles every four years to compensate, but it's difficult to guarantee this level of adoption. It's essential to have consistent increasing demand and adoption over time to avoid a potential collapse through this potential security flaw.  It is worth noting, that there may be some leeway in the required adoption rate going forward, as it is difficult to identify the base price which exponential doubling must begin.  If this is in fact a legitimate issue, we may still have plenty of time before this issue presents any real harm.# Solutions?I've been struggling to find good resources with answers or solutions to this particular Bitcoin problem. That's why I'm creating this thread - I need help.  I also want to bring attention to this issue, because I've hardly seen anyone discussing it openly, even though it could be a significant flaw.The question we must ask is whether we're buying into a currency and story claiming inevitable success, when in fact, failure may be over the horizon. Currently, Bitcoin relies on inflation to function. Could it simply be impossible to create a truly deflationary currency that could work within the laws of physics in our reality? Perhaps there's a reason why true deflationary value has never existed before Bitcoin.  I'm eager to find out more.I've noticed a lot of uncertainty regarding this topic within the Bitcoin community. Most other Bitcoin concerns have clear answers and solutions, but this one doesn't as far as I can find. Here are a few ideas I have come across so far:1. The Crossover Point chart might just be experiencing a setback and could recover at some point allowing transaction fees to increase over time as expected.  I haven't found a way to prove this.2. The Lightning network could potentially help with this issue, as continuous adoption seems to be key to this issue. However, this solution has its own drawbacks, and it's unclear whether it can really solve the problem. See videos by [CoinMarketCap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8si1gB8siTA&t=806s&ab_channel=CoinMarketCap) or [Till Musshoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GUFpBr1mwA&t=68s&ab_channel=TillMusshoff) for info on this.3. Merged mining is another option, but I don't fully understand it. From what I've read, it may not be a certain solution, only a potential one. It involves Bitcoin mining simultaneously with other cryptocurrencies, but the value of those coins needs to be retained for this to work over the long-term. The two videos I mentioned earlier also mention this topic.4. One of my theories is that Bitcoin's natural adoption over the next 120 years, leading up to the final Bitcoin being mined, will increase the network's value enough that the problem will eventually disappear. As technology advances, computing and energy costs may decrease to the point where hashing is nearly free, and everyone naturally contributes to the network through various means. However, this raises concerns in bad actors having access to the same advancements and low costs creating a zero-sum game. There are other challenges to this idea as well which I may not be able to foresee.# My Potential SolutionBitcoin's current design flaw is that it is finite in its divisibility, each bitcoin only divisible by 100 million satoshis. This means that eventually all bitcoin will be mined, and miners will only be incentivized by transaction fees which may not suffice as recognized earlier. To solve this issue, my proposed solution is to increase the level of divisibility by regularly updating bitcoin to add decimal points to the amount of satoshis per bitcoin.This change would make Bitcoin permanently disinflationary rather than becoming deflationary by allowing the protocol to run out of satoshis to mine. As the level of divisibility increases, miners would be able to continuously mine smaller and smaller fractions of bitcoin as the supply of satoshis within each bitcoin inflate in supply. Coupled with Bitcoin's potential for exponential growth, the logarithmic behavior of increasing bitcoin divisibility like this could create a stable and sustainable mining incentive model.By increasing the level of divisibility in this manner, the supply of bitcoin would not be affected, and bitcoin would remain capped at 21 million, thus not impacting its price. This would provide a sustainable model for miners to continue earning rewards for mining, as opposed to relying solely on transaction fees.This proposed solution requires feedback and input from the community to be implemented effectively. However, the potential benefits of this solution include a sustainable mining model and a stable and disinflationary Bitcoin ecosystem.Potential issues:1. This idea is subject to further review at this time, as my understanding of it alone likely isn't good enough.2. I am unaware if there are any drawbacks to adding zeroes to the Satoshi count. (Increasing Each Bitcoin total Divisibility).# ConclusionUpon closer examination, it seems that there is one key issue with Bitcoin that warrants further discussion; the security subsidy schedule problem. While Bitcoin has been touted as being backed by mathematics, the lack of clarity around the mining reward subsidy model raises concerns about Bitcoin's long-term viability as it currently stands. To address this issue, I propose increasing the level of divisibility in Bitcoin by regularly adding decimal points to the amount of satoshis per Bitcoin. This would enable miners to continue mining smaller fractions of Bitcoin and ensure that the coin remains capped at 21 million, without impacting its price.I am eager to engage with the community and learn more about how this issue can be resolved. Is there a natural solution, or will developers and Bitcoiners need to work together to implement code changes and forks? While this issue has caused me to stumble, I am not completely convinced against Bitcoin, and will continue to invest through dollar-cost averaging. Perhaps the existence of potential solutions means that one will inevitably emerge to save the day. By working together and exploring new solutions, my hope is to ensure the long-term success of Bitcoin.Thank you.# Additional Information & Resources[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8si1gB8siTA&t=806s&ab'_channel=CoinMarketCap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8si1gB8siTA&t=806s&ab_channel=CoinMarketCap)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GUFpBr1mwA&t=68s&ab'_channel=TillMusshoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GUFpBr1mwA&t=68s&ab_channel=TillMusshoff)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYhNNSLWX4g&t=1s&ab'_channel=TraderUniversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYhNNSLWX4g&t=1s&ab_channel=TraderUniversity)[https://joekelly100.medium.com/how-to-kill-bitcoin-part-1-is-bitcoin-unstoppable-code-7a1b366f65ee](https://joekelly100.medium.com/how-to-kill-bitcoin-part-1-is-bitcoin-unstoppable-code-7a1b366f65ee)[https://joekelly100.medium.com/on-bitcoins-fee-based-security-model-part-1-beware-the-turkey-fallacy-4285e18d41ea](https://joekelly100.medium.com/on-bitcoins-fee-based-security-model-part-1-beware-the-turkey-fallacy-4285e18d41ea)[https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8)",False,The Bitcoin Economy - No One is Talking About Bitcoin's Biggest Problem!,u/[deleted],0,20,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1271xn2/the_bitcoin_economy_no_one_is_talking_about/,[]

It's hard to HODL bitcoin. And most people can't do it. The ups and downs and the emotions are excruciating. It's fun at first if you catch the right timing. You put in a few thousand shortly after the halving and within no time you have 5 figures and climbing. This is great! Then after some more months or a year, you're getting close to 6 figures in bitcoin which is a bit life changing. You're thinking to yourself, should I sell? Should I get out and call it a day? Put a down payment on a house and pay off my car? No you say, I'll HODL this biatch to mad riches in no time... bitcoin to the moon!Then comes the plunge. Giant red candles on the daily and suddenly half your life changing money is gone in less than a week. OMG, why did I HODL?!? Why didn't I sell!?! It's probably all over. Bitcoin is going to zero... bitcoin is dead! AGAIN! LOL But you decide to HODL on... and still it goes lower. You barely hold on to 5 figures again. You're questioning yourself and your sanity. Your friends and family are calling and they're pissed. What the hell is this crap thing called bitcoin you told me about. You reflect... you can't sleep, you wonder if you blew it... less than 5 figures left now... But wait... more time has passed and there's this thing coming up again soon. It's that thing called the halving... so you decide to HODL some more. In fact, you BUY THE F'ING DIP with another 10k! He who dares wins!Suddenly bitcoin finds a bottom. The severe reduction of supply by the halving is reflected in the increasing price. More people in countries around the globe are buying in this new 24x7 global market. New bitcoiners in Africa are joining with those in Asia, US, Europe, etc. Major funds, pensions, wealthy celebrities, and others rushing in. Suddenly you're back to 6 figures and approaching mid 6 figures quickly. You can actually see the day that you, the average Joe, could possibly be a millionaire. More companies are adding bitcoin to their treasury globally. They want to buy your bitcoin desperately!!! There are only ever 21 million in existence after all. And '~4-6 million of those are lost forever. So you HODL some more. Sorry, I'm not selling people. You can possibly have 'some' of my bitcoin for 1 million each to start. Then comes the plunge... and the cycle begins anew. Except this time you're losing much larger amounts and it feels like much faster... you just lost 200k in a month and it's still dropping... bitcoin is dead! Yet AGAIN!  How many of these could you handle? Could you HODL? The good news is it gets easier... sorta... on your second or third cycle if you can make it. HODL'ing is VERY easy in theory but VERY difficult in practice. To HODL for years is to expect a gut wrenching ride along the way. It's not 'easy' money at all as you can see. And many times it's not fun at all. On some days it's down right sickening (down 35% in a day?). It's all up to you... you can be your own bank... if you can just HODL on and don't lose your keys.

Its digital nature makes it very useful to transact from any point in the world in a borderless, permissionless fashion.**So what's the big deal?** We get it, money is already digital, being no more than ones and zeros in your bank account, with nice paper versions of it which we carry around and refer to as cash. However, we rely on institutions such as banks to perform and more importantly validate these payments.When it comes to digital assets such as vacation photos, your book report on Moby Dick or virtually everything in your hard drive, files are very easily copied and replicated. This is very problematic when it comes to creating digital money that should only be spent once, so we trust third parties to carry out these transactions.An example of this is paying for your coffee in cash: you give the cashier money and unless you steal it back, you stop owning that money. But when you send your coworker a Powerpoint presentation, what you are actually sending is a copy of that file, and they can make unlimited copies of it. This is why we need banks to deduct the cost of your coffee and (digitally) give that money to Starbucks.**Bitcoin solves this,** the protocol is not owned by anyone and operates by mathematical rules, so every ten minutes the entire network agrees on what transactions have happened and who currently has the money. These are listed in the Blockchain, a decentralized, replicated database which will be explained in a different article.**So what's in it for me?** Remember when you had to book your flights and hotels through a travel agent? Neither do we, but the Internet has the habit of changing things for good, and it doesn't seem we're going back to landlines and cable television anytime soon.Cryptocurrencies allow for any person on the planet to transact with any other person on the planet, eliminating the need for middlemen such as governments, banks and financial institutions, making it extremely efficient but also very threatening to these agents. Also, as with stimulus bills in the US, the constant printing of money has a devaluating effect on currency, with drastic effects on the economy, whereas with Bitcoin, the supply is fixed at 21 million coins.So Bitcoin allows you to move value digitally, without the control of governments or institutions, in a relatively private manner, and because central banks cannot create more of it, it will likely increase in value over time.This is very useful when crises and inflationary monetary policies reduce national currencies to fractions of its value (think Venezuela); when totalitarian governments force people to flee the country carrying gold and other valuables physically (think Nazi Germany); and for the billion people on the planet who do not have access to banking or financial products (think sub-Saharan Africa).**So what do I do?** The cryptocurrency industry has been around for a bit more than a decade, but it's not going anywhere anytime soon. As more products and services become digitized and dematerialized, digital assets are bound to become more and more relevant. Though it is up to you to decide whether to partake in it or not, we recommend you keep an eye out for the evolution of the industry.*Written during April 7-8 2021*",False,What You Need to Know About Bitcoin,u/[deleted],0,2,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/126pagf/what_you_need_to_know_about_bitcoin/,[]

But regardless, it's absolutely a hedge against an authoritarian state. Bitcoin will gain strength in direct proportion to the state. The less responsible state monetary and fiscal policy, the stronger bitcoin becomes. Bitcoin is the diametric opposition to the reckless spending, irresponsible behavior, and chronic overreach of the state. It would not be necessary otherwise. If, tomorrow, there was a legitimate and genuine bipartisan move towards a responsible fiscal and monetary policy and a strong currency, bitcoin would almost certainly drop in price. But as we all know, the dollar is backed by nothing more than the full faith and credit of the United States government, which is ironic more and more scarce all the time. And as that level of faith and credit falls, bitcoin rises. So, maybe it is an inflationary hedge, but if it is that's only a secondary effect, because it's a hedge against *a state that tends towards inflationism*, a state that can't help but impose its will by violence because no one would consent to it otherwise, a state that uses manufactured inflation to drink your milkshake. That's the real hedge. And if the state stopped doing that tomorrow, we might not feel like stacking sats was so urgent. But they'd always be there waiting for us, because in my opinion states *always* trend towards authoritarian. And so, bitcoin or something like it is a natural and emergent property of all economies.

Section VIII of the measure contains the financial and final provisions.&#x200B;Regulation (EU) 2022/858, in order to take into account the spread of distributed ledger technology (DLT), of which crypto-assets are one of the main applications, provides a European legal framework to bring some crypto-assets within the scope of EU financial services legislation. The EU regulation addresses the phenomenon of so-called tokenization of financial instruments, i.e. the digital representation of financial instruments in distributed ledgers or the issuance of traditional asset classes in tokenized format to enable their issuance, custody and transfer in a distributed ledger.&#x200B;In a nutshell, a distributed ledger is a database, i.e. a repository of information, shared and synchronised: each update of the ledger itself must be approved according to a specific validation process. The distributed nature of the registry and the different ways in which validation processes work characterise cryptocurrencies and other blockchains in which the validation process is not centralised but can also be, to varying degrees, distributed.&#x200B;In order to enable the development of cryptocurrencies that fall under the definition of financial instruments and the development of distributed ledger technology, while preserving a high level of investor protection, market integrity, financial stability and transparency, and avoiding regulatory arbitrage and loopholes, the EU regulation creates a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology. This regime allows certain DLT market infrastructures to be temporarily exempted from certain specific requirements under EU financial services legislation that might otherwise prevent operators from developing solutions for the trading and settlement of cryptocurrency transactions falling within the definition of financial instruments, without weakening any of the existing requirements or safeguards applied to traditional market infrastructures. This allows the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and competent authorities to gain experience on the specific opportunities and risks related to crypto-assets falling under the definition of financial instruments and the underlying technologies.&#x200B;The experience gained from the pilot scheme is intended to identify possible practical proposals for a suitable regulatory framework in order to make targeted adjustments to Union legislation on the issuance, custody and administration of assets, trading and settlement of DLT financial instruments.&#x200B;In order to enable the application and operation in Italy of the aforementioned pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology (DLT pilot regime), the provisions of Chapter I of the Decree-Law regulate the issuance and circulation of certain categories of financial instruments through the use of distributed ledger or similar technologies.&#x200B;Chapter I, Section VII of the decree under review introduces measures to simplify the FinTech experimentation. Fintech experimentation was regulated by Decree-Law No. 34 of 2019 (so-called Growth), which provided for a so-called regulatory sandbox, i.e. a controlled environment where supervised intermediaries and FinTech operators can test, for a limited period of time, technologically innovative products and services in the banking, financial and insurance sectors. The testing takes place in constant dialogue with the supervisory authorities (Bank of Italy, CONSOB and IVASS), possibly benefiting from a simplified transitional regime. The Government, in its Explanatory Report, notes that the first application of the rules governing the sandbox has revealed certain rigidities that may not allow the full use of the new instrument in favour of innovation. The rules under comment therefore introduce simplification measures aimed at ensuring the widest possible operation of the rules introduced in 2019.&#x200B;The PRESIDENT recalls that the preliminary stage of the decree in question envisages the hearing of the Bank of Italy, CONSOB and IVASS in the sitting of Tuesday, 4 April.&#x200B;Senators CROATTI (M5S) and ZEDDA (FdI) propose to acquire the documentation of ItaliaFintech, AssoDeFi and the National Council of Notaries.&#x200B;The PRESIDENT took note of this proposal.&#x200B;He proposes to convene the plenary session and the Bureau already convened for tomorrow.&#x200B;He proposed setting Thursday 6 April at 12 noon as the deadline for submitting agendas and amendments.&#x200B;The Commission agrees.&#x200B;The continuation of the examination is postponed.",False,Italy introduces a simplified regulation to 'allow DLT market infrastructures to develop solutions for the trading and settlement of cryptocurrency transactions falling within the definition of financial instruments' and 'to gain experience on opportunities and risks related to crypto-assets',u/[deleted],0,17,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/125y66a/italy_introduces_a_simplified_regulation_to_allow/,[]

And despite all of this, the twins have made quite a comeback for their second act, becoming Bitcoin billionaires' in the process.**The plot** begins with the later stages of the legal battle, in which some of Zuckerberg's wrongdoings are elucidated, such as calling Harvard students dumb fucks for trusting him with their emails and personal information, or hacking ConnectU (the twins' failed social network) to make a white supermacist version of Cameron's profile.Leaving the social madness behind, the twins set out to launch their investment firm, Winklevoss Capital, but quickly discover that no one will take their money, for fear of being scorned by the Facebook empire, and so they set out to do what any normal person would do in 2012 with 65 million dollars, go party in Ibiza.But no Mediterranean party comes without its fair share of weirdos, and thus the twins are introduced to the magic Internet money of Bitcoin and afterwards to Charlie Shrem and BitInstant. The now defunct company was one of the first exchanges helping people buy Bitcoin in an easy way which the brothers became investors for.**Talk about paranoia.** Deep inside the rabbit hole and having acquired approximately 1% of all coins in circulation, mainly from the infamous Mt. Gox, the book depicts the security protocol that the twins design in order to keep their fortune safe: twelve safety-deposit boxes, held across three different banking institutions, and spread across four distinct regions in the United States, each holding a third of their private keys; meaning that no one could acquire them by accessing any individual box. Afterwards, they go as far as destroying all of their electronics with a sledgehammer, erasing any digital fingerprints in the process.**Cryptolore.** What makes the book so entertaining for anyone interested in cryptocurrency, is that it recounts many of the milestones and dark chapters of Bitcoin's history in cinematographic fashion, such as the arrest of Ross Ulbricht. The creator of the online black market Silk Road which mainly used cryptocurrency for its transactions, had his laptop seized by two FBI agents enacting a couple's quarrel.**Which brings us to Naval.** Another interesting discovery within the book is Naval Ravikant's feature in it, inviting the brothers to a meeting called The Genesis Block in which technical heavyweights from companies like Paypal, BitTorrent, Google Chrome and Coinbase gather to discuss the future of Bitcoin. Naval, a wildly successful investor, is nowadays better known for his philosophical views and practical spirituality, and has developed a cultlike following after his appearance in the Joe Rogan podcast.**In the end, redemption.** Done with the trials and tribulations of the infant industry, the book calls it a day right after Gemini is launched, the twins' fully regulated, fully compliant, virtual currency exchange headquartered in New York, which seems to be doing quite well these days, considering Bitcoin is hovering above $50,000.*If you made it all the way here wondering whether we'd use the word Winklevii' at some point, we didn't.*",False,Naval Ravikant is in 'Bitcoin Billionaires' [Book Summary],u/[deleted],0,14,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/125wqta/naval_ravikant_is_in_bitcoin_billionaires_book/,[]

The internet has been mainstream for 25 years. The world is not the same as it was in 1980 1880 or 1780. We now live in a world where digital nomads and remote workers can live and work from anywhere on earth, they can change accomodation on a monthly basis and transverse the globe while earning an honest and legitimate living. We live in a world where professional expat workers are brought in by large corporations and given accomodation in serviced apartments and hotels. We live in a world where it is completely normal to be a perpetual traveller and not need a permanent address.Yet financial services still require you to provide proof of address in the form of a minimum one year lease agreement or similar. This is such a prehistoric practice. All they should require is a valid passport and perhaps proof of your tax residence in the form of a tax residence certificate. It is not the 1800s anymore, requiring proof of address is so insanely detrimental to financial inclusion. Its not only the worlds poor in developing countries that cannot provide these documents and are therefore barred from all financial services, it is now increasingly barring digital nomads, remote workers and expats from opening accounts with any new financial services platform.Anyone who has ever moved countries and tried to open a new bank account before they have a lease agreement will attest to this. The irony is you cannot initiate a new lease agreement until you have a local bank account and you cannot get a local bank account until you have proof of address. I seriously despise any service that requires something as draconian and ancient as proof of address to allow you access to their platform as all it does is destroy financial inclusion.According to some statistics there are more than 40 million digital nomads, more than 100 million full time remote workers and more than 100 million expats worldwide. The financial services industry does not effectively serve these ~250 million people worldwide simply because they require 'proof of address'.Luckily there is one monetary network that will allow you to use it whether you have a permanent address or not. Bitcoin doesnt discriminate, as long as you have some sats it will allow you to store your value, travel with your value and transact with your value all without ever asking for something as stupid as proof of address.Bitcoin isnt just for the developing worlds unbanked and underbanked.

This is what I don't understand and why I don't see any monetary value in it besides a pump and dump to make $$$. Which if that is what everyone is using it for I get it. Even at it's current price I don't get why I should spend 25k on it when I can do everything I need to without it.Thanks!",False,Help me understand the value of Bitcoin,u/[deleted],0,8,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12561mx/help_me_understand_the_value_of_bitcoin/,[]

Yet its pretty clear trying to use hundreds of gold custodians across the globe all issuing their own jurisdictionally restricted gold backed tokens would bring back all the problems we have today like which custodians can be trusted to hold the gold, ensure transactions are propogated, and ensure your funds are not frozen or hypothecated.

They are letting the old paradigm control their thinking and this is preventing them from being able to open their eyes to the new paradigm.They are not prepared for the future of money, and bitcoin will completely blindside them while they desperately hang on to their fiat and their gold.Central bankers wont understand it until their respective treasuries need to hold bitcoin as a matter of national security.

In this new paradigm neither gold backed digital currencies or fiat backed digital currencies will be relevant. Within the new paradigm the only relevant digital currency will be one that is backed by real world energy (proof of work), decentralised, politically and jurisdictionally neutral, and one which allows for self custody with zero counterparty risk.

Inaccuracy: I buy BTC from CB Pro, CB and Strike and have tried some of the top portfolio tracker and they're all off by at least 25-50% (tried Koinly, Cointracker - please give me some recs if there are ones that work well for you). I paid Cointracker $59 to get a wrong number - a very frustrating experience.2. No support for HODL-ers: I want to know how my DCA is doing, or what milestones I have achieved this year (i.e percentile of bitcoin ownership etc) to give me some drive to hold longer3. Expensive: Annual fees of 50 - 200 dollars per year. This information should be free of charge be just like looking at your bank account.4. No support for cold wallets.

While this may be true due to its decentralized nature, I have concerns about the US levying high taxes on Bitcoin capital gains in the future. What's to stop the US government from raising capital gains to 75% or 90%? When this type of regulatory question comes up on Twitter or different YouTube videos and debates, the answer is typically 'well, you can vote with your feet and move to a Bitcoin-friendly country'. But for US citizens it's not that easy because you owe US taxes anywhere in the world. Those capital gains will be paid no matter where you are. The next answer I see is 'well, you need to learn about CoinJoin or use Bisq' but do we really expect the average Bitcoin holder to use p2p tech like Bisq if they wanted to sell a large amount of Bitcoin to purchase a home? At this point, you land on the 'well, by then you won't have to sell your Bitcoin because many businesses and companies will have BTC on their balance sheet and will be transacting in BTC'. That's a big if. I do think by 2030 BTC has the chance to hit between $500K-$1M, but I think it's unlikely that by then we'll be transitioning to a Bitcoin world. And I'm afraid sentiment is going to be very negative toward BTC holders - 'can you believe it? $500K a coin and those people did nothing to deserve it!' - which leads to the US government levying high taxes on capital gains.This honestly is keeping me from transitioning the majority of my stocks and assets to Bitcoin. I'm super bullish on BTC but I'm bearish on people in general and governments. I think the US government can make it very difficult for HNW BTC holders to use their earnings.

It is not worth anywhere near as much as it would be were it to reassert itself as the monetary standard for all countries.However gold will not reassert itself as money. At best it will act as a safe haven for people to hide from bank fragility and inflation. It is bitcoin that will end up asserting itself as global money as fiat collapses and all countries enter a global sovereign debt crisis.Gold is worth $12 trillion currently and could double to $25 trillion if used as a safe haven. But if gold is nothing but a safe haven and bitcoin asserts itself as actual global money then bitcoin should be worth many multiples of gold. Conservatively lets say bitcoin should be worth double gold when gold is worth $25 trillion.That puts bitcoin at a $50 trillion market cap just for it to reach fair value during a period of financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis. So lets say today before this financial crisis hits it should be no cheaper than 1/10th of its fair value of $50 trillion (ie $240k per btc).So bitcoins fair value before a financial crisis should realistically be $240k per btc and in the midst of a financial crisis and global sovereign debt crisis it should be worth $2.4m per btc.If we are entering a financial crisis and are at the beginning of a global sovereign debt crisis then bitcoin has to rise 85x just to reach fair value.Bitcoin is ridiculously undervalued!,False,Bitcoin is ridiculously undervalued!,u/[deleted],0,45,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/121l0lk/bitcoin_is_ridiculously_undervalued/,[]

It seems to the outsiders that the latest choke 2.0 operation against Bitcoin and crypto in general is driven primarily by the democrats. The strongest polemics being by sen warren, the sec, the NY state in general, and Biden himself with the latest economic report release. This aggressive regulation without clear setting of the rules of the game (therefore not giving anyone the chance to play by the rules) coincides with the biggest bank crisis since 2008, perfectly timed to cut off leaks from tradfi to Bitcoin and crypto. It all poses the question 'if it is so worthless, why don't you let the free market decide. If it such a bad store of value why don't you let it compete on even playing field.' . My question is, do us citizens consider this a democrats problem? How many of you will vote for democrats in the next election? Do you believe republicans will do better?. Is a change in the leadership of the US going to be a solution or a problem? How many of you voted democrats and now will vote republican?

Please save the criticism, they know they were foolish but they're old and sick and the exact types of people that scammers go after. Direct the negativity towards the shitty people who make a living off ruining peoples lives & please just help if you can.From what I understand, my dads desktop computer froze and a notification popped up saying his computer was hacked and to call this number (saying it was Microsoft) to get help. He called & they told him they were going to transfer him to our banks fraud department. He then gave the phone to my mom. Long story short they convinced my parents that someone had used their bank account to buy cocaine and child porn & if they didn't follow these instructions they'd be arrested. They had my mom go to the bank and pull out $11,000 and then put it into a bitcoin kiosk. They helped my mom create a bitcoin wallet or whatever you call it. She has the receipt & didn't give the receipt number to anyone, but they helped her build the account so. She started asking more and more questions and pressing them because she knew none of this made sense but she was so scared and frazzled. Finally the person on the other end said something along the lines of hahaha fuck you I got your money and hung up. After this is when my parents told me what happened and we've been trying to help ever since. I told them to go to the kiosk ASAP and try to pull the money out if possible. By the time we got there, it was late at night and they were all closed and wouldn't let us access anything. They're going to try again tomorrow morning. A few important details that are giving us the tiniest bit of hope:  	‚ÅÉ	the email my mom used to create the wallet is not an accessible email. It's a cableone email & since cableone shut down, it doesn't really exist anymore but is still able to sign up for things. It's not something they could hack into at this point. 	‚ÅÉ	after they mocked her and hung up, they called her and my father back each 3 times, seemingly frantic. We're wondering if that means they did not actually have all the information they needed to access her bitcoin account and were trying to get it. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if there's any hope for my parents to get this money back, and if so how? If not, we want to know what information these people have. She's afraid they might have all her info and will steal her identity and hack more. Do they go to the police station? Do they call someone? We just don't know where to go from here.

I'm just a worried citizen looking for help.I live in ARGENTINA, a beautiful country with an inflation rate of about 100% per year. Our government insists that we use their currency, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to rely on it as a means of exchange. As a result, more and more people are turning to save their money in other coins as a way to protect their savings from inflation. We're on or way of becoming another Venezuela.The problem is that it's not easy to buy Bitcoin in Argentina. There are few exchanges that allow us to purchase Bitcoin with our local currency, but very fewer that let us do it in a peer-to-peer manner. This makes it incredibly hard for us to access a valuable financial asset that could help us in being capable of saving money.I need to emphasize that the situation in Argentina is very different from that in first-world countries. Here, the government pays close attention to every financial transaction that its citizens make, and we have a set amount of money that we can spend outside our country. As a result, using centralized exchanges to buy Bitcoin is not an option for many of us. We need a P2P solution that allows us to buy Bitcoin in a way that is safe, easy, and private, but most importantly: LOCAL.The lack of easy and accessible P2P Bitcoin transactions is a significant barrier to achieving mass adoption in Argentina. Many people in our country are not tech-savvy, and even more are fearful of government control and taxes. Centralized exchanges can leave a trail of financial transactions that could be subject to government scrutiny and taxation. P2P transactions offer a way to buy and sell Bitcoin anonymously, which could help protect citizens from government surveillance and taxation. By creating a user-friendly platform for P2P Bitcoin transactions, we could help make cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone in Argentina, regardless of their level of technical expertise, and provide a way to protect their wealth from inflation. Or maybe it already exists and it's not well known. I've been searching and i didn't find any.I believe that P2P Bitcoin transactions are crucial for the financial well-being of the people of Argentina. It's time for us to come together and create a platform that allows us to buy and sell Bitcoin in a way that works for us. We need a system that is relatively easy to use, secure, and anonymous. Only then can we truly protect our wealth and build a better future for ourselves and our families.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

One of the main criticisms of Bitcoin is its lack of adoption by mainstream businesses and consumers.However, recent developments in the global financial system suggest that Bitcoin may be poised for wider adoption in the coming years.The downfall of the banking system due to inflation and bank runs has been a recurring theme throughout history. Inflation erodes the value of traditional fiat currencies over time, while bank runs can lead to the collapse of entire financial institutions. As a result, many people are turning to alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin.In addition to the threat of inflation and bank runs, heavy regulation by governments has also been a factor driving people towards Bitcoin. In some countries, governments have imposed strict controls on the flow of capital in and out of the country. This has made it difficult for people to transfer money internationally and has led to the closing down of FIAT on and off ramps via banks. Bitcoin offers a solution to these problems by allowing individuals to transfer value across borders without the need for traditional financial institutions.While the regulatory environment for Bitcoin is still uncertain in many parts of the world, there are signs that governments are starting to take a more positive view of the technology. Look at El Salvador. They adopted Bitcoin as their currency. Recently President Nayib Bukele tweeted;'Next week, I'll be sending a bill to congress to eliminate all taxes (income, property, capital gains and import tariffs) on technology innovations, such as software programming, coding, apps and AI development; as well as computing and communications hardware manufacturing'There are more examples like Lugano and CAR.The downfall of the banking system due to inflation and bank runs, heavy regulation, and the closing down of FIAT on and off ramps via banks may seem like bad news for Bitcoin at first.However, these developments may actually be bullish for the adoption of Bitcoin and the creation of a true circular economy. As more people turn to Bitcoin as a store of value and a means of transferring value across borders, the technology is likely to become more widely accepted and integrated into the global financial system. We don't need tradfi banks as much as we believe. Look at how mobile phones became a replacement for banks in Africa with MPESA.

Combined with robotics and AI, we are on the precious of massive endogenous growth with virtually zero diminishing returns. Something economists and technologists could only dream of. Bitcoin is still far more profound than humanity realizes, and theres a long history of economic theories starting with Thomas Malthus classical theory, the neoclassical theories, and the endogenous growth theory. By incorporating aspects of endogenous growth theory and other economic concepts, we can ALL better understand how Bitcoin might/will/already has contributed to a more sustainable and prosperous future. Hold on because we are going back to some good old fashioned economic theory. Because well.... Bitcoin is #MATH.Y = AK(Hint, Bitcoin is the A AND THE K that inflates forever and brings through honest interest rates)Although some would say that Bitcoin does not inherently ENSURE that there will be no diminishing returns on capital, it sure makes it a lot harder when it reinforces property rights and has perfect monetary policy (as to why the Keynesian idea of quantitative theory is not a true mathematical law, ill point you to Mises and Milton Friedman. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE7zxo61Xc8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE7zxo61Xc8) ). Now, onto WHY we will largely diminish the problem of diminishing returns on capital....Endogenous Growth Theory and Bitcoin: Endogenous growth theory emphasizes the importance of knowledge, innovation, and human capital in driving long-term economic growth. By investing in these areas, economies can experience sustained growth without diminishing returns on capital. Bitcoin, as a decentralized and deflationary digital asset, has the potential to align with this theory in several ways:1. Encouraging savings and investment: Bitcoin's limited supply and deflationary nature make it an attractive store of value. As individuals and institutions choose to save and invest in Bitcoin, capital accumulation can increase, leading to higher levels of investment in technology, education, and other areas that contribute to endogenous growth.2. Facilitating technological innovation: Bitcoin's underlying technology, blockchain, has opened new doors for innovation in various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and digital identity. As more individuals and companies adopt and develop blockchain technology, the increased technological progress can contribute to economic growth.3. Enhancing human capital: Bitcoin and blockchain technology require a skilled workforce to develop and maintain the underlying infrastructure. By creating demand for expertise in these areas, Bitcoin can encourage investment in education and training, leading to an increase in human capital, a critical component of endogenous growth theory.Bitcoin as a Savings Technology: Bitcoin's unique properties as a digital asset make it a powerful savings technology with the potential to improve the economic outlook for individuals and nations alike:1. Protection against inflation: Bitcoin's limited supply and decentralized nature protect it from inflationary pressures that can erode the value of traditional currencies. By preserving purchasing power, Bitcoin can encourage savings and investment, driving capital accumulation and economic growth.2. Financial inclusion: Bitcoin offers a borderless and permissionless means of saving and transacting, enabling greater financial inclusion for individuals worldwide. By providing access to financial services for unbanked and underbanked populations, Bitcoin can help unlock untapped economic potential, contributing to global growth.3. Diversification: As an asset class, Bitcoin is relatively uncorrelated to traditional financial assets, making it an attractive option for diversifying investment portfolios. By reducing risk and encouraging investment, Bitcoin can contribute to a more stable economic environment that fosters growth.Buy BTC, and use it with your friends and family.",False,Bitcoin and Endogenous Growth Theory: A Path to Sustainable Economic Growth (history lesson lol),u/[deleted],0,10,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1210wz6/bitcoin_and_endogenous_growth_theory_a_path_to/,[]

The tech IMO is undeniable and if you put the FUD aside you can see through the smoke and mirrors that there are very legitimate use cases for it and its only a mtter of time before governments and institutions capitulate to the technology. Its inevitable.That said crytpo has many downfalls as well from CEX scandals. People over leveraging, impermanent loss,  Governments and politicians threatening harsh regulation, Energy concerns with mining, people making bad investments, lost seeds  and so on but for me the worse thing that can happen. Crypto's biggest downfall is the potential of loss funds due to a smart contract exploitation. Imagine not checking your balance for a month only to open your wallet and find it was drained by some jerk off two weeks ago. All gone. Every coin, token and NFT. You follow the trail and see it has now ran off to multiple addresses and funneled out via some foreign exchange.This is cryptos main weakness. This is every non user or noobs biggest turn off about crypto and every users worst nightmare. It has happened to so many and we will continue to hear this for the next few years. Crypto devs must fix this but sadly its not easy. You may have signed a contract months ago and if you haven't revoked the transaction you may be victim of full loss. Seems unfair but sadly this is a current reality and major problem crytpo and us the users face.Wanted to get  your thoughts on this. Do you agree with me that this should be of the highest priority for devs to fix. Mass adoption may or may not arrive but if this ins't fixed by that time many won't stick around.

As we all know, MOONs are probably the subs favorite token besides BTC and ETH but what could the future hold for us? I just want to check if it makes sense to take the gamble and actually invest into MOONs.**Possible positive outcomes:**1. MOONs get integrated into the reddit NFT marketplace. This might boost the demand of moons heavily since we already saw that NFTs are in huge demand on reddit. The subreddit gets more and more attention and therefore people consider to take a deeper look into MOONs.2. MOONs get adapted from other subreddits. MOONs itself build up a complete ecosystem in reddit as social token and we might see further adaption besides governance such as participation ranks, lift karma entries to post on other subs by proving you are participating on reddit in a good will through earning moons or simply buy addons for participating subreddits.3. MOONs get listed on big exchanges (hello Kraken). This obviously could also be an outcome of the stated points above and it will push the demand and price of the token potentially enormously.4. MOONs get adopted on other social media platforms. After the concept behind MOONs as social token gets approved over time on reddit by getting more features on the platform to be an integral part of reddit overall, other social media platforms could start to integrate it. That obviously would be the dream scenario to push MOONs into THE social token with its first mover advantage. **Possible negative outcomes:**1. The SEC doesn't like the concept of MOONs and take action against reddit, which results - in the worst case scenario - into removing MOONs from the platform.2. Centralization: MOONs are pretty centralized due to the fact how they get distributed each round with a special bonus to a small group of people. That point might be an issue regarding adoption outside the subreddit but time will tell.All in all, I consider the potential positive outcomes as a great opportunity for myself. However, especially point 4 is probably years away and would be the best case scenario for MOONs - unlikely but in my opinion possible. Let me know what you guys think about MOONs and which other features the token could bring in the future.Just a note: This is my own opinion and in no way an investment advice.

It also affects non-Moon contracts as well. Refer to the post liked above for if Sushiswap has recovered your funds in their whitehat address or if you need alternative measures. It also gives a basic outline on how to revoke approvals which is the exploited part of the contract but I've also included a more detailed tutorial below . But here is how unlimited spends work and how to set and revoke spend limits.By default, if you approve a transaction, the contract by default is *technically* permitted to 'spend' as many tokens as it likes, as the default spend value is a very high number. However of course, 'good' contracts won't do this. But if you have a hacked or exploited contract, you can lose all funds, like what happened with some users. Luckily, you can also explicitly define how many tokens you allow the contract to spend, although unluckily it is not the default and is more of a 'advanced user' option.Here I include two tutorials:1. How to revoke or change already-set spend limits2. How to approve tokens and set token spend limits(go here if it's your first time swapping)Tutorial 2 is a follow-up to tutorial 1 as it explains the effects or 'consequences' of revoking spend limits.# Tutorial: How to Revoke Approvals or Change Spend Limits1.

However, despite the hype, interest in the Metaverse seems to be waning. What are your thoughts?First, let's define what we mean by the Metaverse. The term was coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash, and it refers to a hypothetical future version of the internet that's more immersive and interactive. In the Metaverse, users would be able to inhabit virtual worlds and interact with each other in real-time, using avatars to represent themselves.One reason why the Metaverse is losing public interest is due to a lack of successful implementations. There have been many attempts at creating a Metaverse, but most have failed to gain traction with users. For example, Second Life was one of the first virtual worlds to gain widespread attention, with millions of users in its day. However, it failed to live up to its potential and has since declined in popularity. Another example is Blue Mars, a virtual world that was launched in 2009 with high hopes, but ultimately failed due to technical issues and a lack of user engagement. Another reason for the decline in interest in the Metaverse is a lack of clear applications. While some companies are using VR and AR technology for training simulations and other practical purposes, there hasn't been a killer app or use case for the Metaverse that's captured the public's imagination. Without a clear reason to use the Metaverse, it's hard to get people excited about it.Lastly, there may be some skepticism around the idea of the Metaverse as a replacement for real life interactions. While it's true that the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards remote work and online interactions, there's still a sense that virtual interactions can't fully replace in person ones.

Stocks will rally and Crypto will be ready to follow up with a high correlation and also as the USD will be weakening even more than right now.# Case 2: FED raises ratesIn a possible scenario where they realise that their rate hikes have been very ineffective and inflation is still too high or even increases further.This will cause even further turmoil in the banking sector as we have seen with SVB as apparently they were all too busy to actually hedge against rate hikes that every Redditor saw from a mile away. Causing further banks to collapse, which on the other hand will make more people hedge in to Bitcoin and thus go up here too.In conclusion, we can see that no matter what the FED does it will be good for Bitcoin and all of Crypto and we are now at a position where further rate cuts or fewer dont make any difference at all.

A wallet that allows you to restore it through the use of biometric data, such as a finger print, ocular / facial recognition, rather than the use of a seed phrase.  I realise the seed phrase will still be needed, and it may require the service to securely store it in an encrypted fashion so that it can be matched with your biometric data. 3.

Prices will vary, but going off of Gen 1 and Gen 2, the prices ranged from $4.99 to $100 per avatar. The more expensive, the smaller the collection size, which increases the rarity. Don't forget to create your Vault first. (Your personal digital wallet, which holds your avatars and cryptocurrencies) **Creating your vault: (IMPORTANT)** **For new users, tap the Profile icon, tap your default avatar or profile picture, then tap 'You.' After that, you'll see 'Your Stuff.' Tap that tab, and on the middle right of the screen you'll see a little spaceship-looking icon. This will walk you through creating your first vault.** **For existing Redditors, if you tap the profile icon, you should see the Vault option in the menu. If you do, just finish following the vault creation process with the steps above.** **Remember your secret seed phrase that is generated for you. Write it down and keep it safe, because if you lose it, there's no way to recover your assets. Do not share it with anyone either. There is an option to backup your vault to Reddit and the cloud, but use at your own discretion.**This process is just a few quick steps, and with some furious refreshing on drop day, you will be on your way to minting some Reddit Collectible Avatars. **Minting Reddit Collectible Avatars from the Reddit Mobile App:** 1. Before anything, you will want to have the appropriate payment methods ready ahead of time. Options range from connecting your credit or debit account to your App Store or Google Play Store account to preloading with gift cards (Apple gift card that credits your App Store account or Google Play Store), which is another way to pay and a good backup plan in case your bank locks your card due to multiple rapid transactions. (AKA, Fraud Alert). Also, depending on your location and availability you can pay through your phone bill and Ideal (online payment method). Having a phone with PayPal connected to Google/Apple Pay as backup is another option. 2. Download the Reddit mobile app from the App Store or Google Play Store. 3. Log in to your Reddit account. 4. Tap the profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen. 5. Tap on the 'Shop' tab. 6. You can stay on this screen and scroll down to search for your desired artist/s by series size, style, or price. (Or refer to Step 7 to sort just by price.) 7. Press 'Browse All Collectibles' to sort by price. 8. Then select the avatar you want to buy. 9. Proceed with your purchase.

And people will call this FUD but sharing concerns and being open to having them debunked is not FUD. FUD is only FUD until it's not.I used to play with leverage on Binance and yes I know the risks behind it and it's not recommended, but that's not the point. Again, I used to used leverage trading on Binance and I noticed a very strange coincidence. Sometimes, I would see the chart trade sideways for a while but slowly go downward, and then suddenly take a deep dive, very similar to what looks like a liquidation, and immediately after the chart would shoot straight upward. I can even confirm on multiple occasions that I myself get liquidated ona chart that was mostly crabbing sideways but trending downward, and right after I'm liquidated the chart shoots straight up.This always confused me because think about this:1. If I have a leveraged position, that means the supply of tokens available to trade is reduced, and thus the price should have upward pressure. But instead the exact opposite happens.2. If I am liquidated and my position sold at market price, the price should *tank* and stay relatively low, as a large amount of supply is suddenly released on the market and it should have downward price pressure. But again the opposite happens,I have never had these weird chart behaviours happen on any other trading platform I used so it was very strange to me.

Then once you finally have it and go, it's gone forever. What if instead that ticket was a NFT? Now you could have it be instantly verifiable as genuine.

When people complain about their wallet being hacked and are adamant that they did nothing to expose themselves to the risk, 99% of the time it's because they've left an authorization open from a prior transaction which was exploited by a bad actor. Sometimes the funds may be immediately withdrawn from your wallet after you've connected to the site and given it approval, and other times the hacker may not exploit the authorization for weeks or months after it was initiated - it may be that you connected to a reputable site, and the authorization was exploited at a later date or the hacker might have been waiting for you to send more crypto to your wallet.Many people believe that if you disconnect your wallet from a site or app, you've neutralized the risk of that site accessing your wallet. This is not the case. Disconnecting the wallet from the site or app makes no difference if an authorization to make transactions in your wallet remains open. You only neutralize the risk by revoking the authorization that you granted. Many people aren't aware of this, and are blissfully ignorant of the fact that their wallets have authorizations open that can be exploited at any time - I bet many of you reading this are in this situation right now. When I first checked, I had three random authorizations open I wasn't aware of.Fortunately, if you know what you're doing, removing this authorisation is actually quite easy. 1. Go to revoke.cash (there are other sites that do this, but I've used this site for a while and I trust it).2. Put your public address into the bar on the top of the page (don't connect your wallet just yet). If you use different accounts within your wallet, you'll obviously need to do this exercise for the public address of each of them.3. Scroll down and see what authorizations are open against your wallet. You'll need to toggle through each of the different networks (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon etc) to make sure you've caught them all.4. If you spot an authorisation you're not familiar with, or you're worried about, connect your wallet and click revoke. You can investigate the authorization by clicking on the address that has been given the authorization. You'll need to pay gas fees to revoke the authorization. It is good practice to review your authorisations frequently (I do it weekly). Revoke.cash may show you some random tokens in your wallet that you weren't aware you had - basically airdrops of coins to your wallet without your knowledge. Ignore these - don't try and import them into your wallet or go to a website looking to find out more about them. They are very likely scam coins airdropped to you by hackers looking for you to interact with them.Remember not all authorizations are bad; for example, you may have a limit order open on 1nch, and you may need an authorization open for that in order for that limit order to be filled.

I bought very little in the first half of 2022, and after the crash I started buying semi-regularly since June 15th. However, I sometimes make very few purchases during a couple weeks, while I may do a large lump sum over the course of a few days in one week. Price generally hasn't affected my buying except in a few cases. During the FTX crash I stopped buying while exchanges and lenders were freezing things and then bought more in December. Before the ETH merge in September I stopped buying and planned to buy a couple weeks after. Otherwise pretty consistent inflow of cash to buy more crypto. At this points my reserves are almost up. Maybe 5-10% left before I stop and switch to only income. With all the banking issues I focused on wiping out any debt I have and am down to only low-interest debt (i.e. student loans). With the recent move with Bitcoin and alts not moving as much my heavy purchases of alts is now pulling me down. I am only 4% in profits at the moment, as much of the profits of BTC are being outweighed by the red in alts. BTC is at 36% ROI at the current moment. This is #3 of the 14 coins I am in. FTM of course is still outperforming at 100% ROI. However, I bought more at the current prices and that lowered the ROI for FTM(as it was over 200% a couple months ago at the recent high). Same with many alts over the last couple months. Surprisingly my small GRT holding is at 39%. Other purchases over the last 10 months that are solidly in the green are ETH at 25% and MATIC at 22%. AAVE, LINK, LRC, and VET are all barely positive or barely negative. EGLD and KDA are still down the most near -20%. KDA still has a high inflation rate and will likely have poor returns till after the halving. I don't have a good opinion on why EGLD would still be down except with the rebranding not holding it up well in a bear market. So up till this last month BTC was always a top half performer, but NOW it is a top 3, and is a clear winner as being the Bitcoin Standard of crypto. I am a long-term hodler though, not trading, and planning on selling the bulk of my crypto Q4 2024 through Q1/2 2025 if the 4 year cycle bullrun follows past patterns. So current ROI doesn't bother me much with the level of risk I'm willing to take. Even with weekly investments into my Roth IRA and 401(k) crypto still makes up about 70-80% of my investment portfolio. Currently. I'd like to see it's worth be about double by the beginning of 2024, but I doubt I can get it that high by then, and that the market will pull it that high. However, I hope to be proven wrong!Best of luck out there everyone! Be patient. Move your assets off exchanges. Don't invest what you can't afford to take out over the next 6 months to a year.

This chain is going to act as a native asset issuance chain, which will act as the native chain for USDC to launch on. That means that people will be able to directly deposit their dollars into Circle, and receive USDC directly into the Cosmos/IBC ecosystem.This solves a problem that has plagued the Cosmos ecosystem, liquidity fragmentation. This issue grew to prominence through the necessity of wrapping USDC, through bridging protocols such as Axelar or Gravity bridge. However, now that native USDC is releasing straight into the Cosmos ecosystem, this fragmentation problem will be eliminated with no real necessity for USDC arbitrage, and no bridge risk.This blockchain is a huge opportunity for the Cosmos ecosystem to gain serious liquidity and for people and entities to trade using a native version of USDC in the Cosmos ecosystem. There are already projects like Osmosis, which has a proposal to allow fees on the blockchain to be paid using USDC as well as their native OSMO token.The next step in advancing liquidity in the Cosmos ecosystem is here. The mainnet launch of Noble is on March 27th, and native USDC will be issued soon after that mainnet launch. Cosmoszn is about to begin, as a new era of Cosmos liquidity is upon us. ***Edit: TLDR; USDC has not been issued natively in the Cosmos ecosystem. So if people wanted to put USDC into the various Cosmos ecosystem chains, they would have to bridge USDC over from ETH. However, Circle is starting their own sovereign blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, that will allow for USDC to be issued directly onto their own chain, Noble, and then it can be sent to other chains in the Cosmos ecosystem. So there is no longer any reason to bridge USDC from ETH over to the Cosmos ecosystem.

[Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/109506/how-binance-is-training-law-enforcement-around-the-world-to-combat-crypto-crime). They reportedly have an in-house team including former IRS and CIA agents that collaborated and trained law enforcement around the world, as well as got called in to help during cases by global agencies. Binance, the good guys for sure, right?And now a few months later into spring 2023, CZ and Binance are hit with a lawsuit by the US CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which can only file a civil lawsuit, not a criminal charge) that alleges, through private/sensitive intel including texts from CZ's and other Binance admins devices, that Binance engages in actively coaching VIP clients based in the US to access global Binance derivatives (illegal for those customers) with VPNs while avoiding KYC through site loopholes. They also allege that Binance turned a blind eye to transactions and accounts from Hamas that potentially facilitated terrorist activity and criminal transactions by Russian groups. (The text quotes: Like come on. They are here for crime. we see the bad, but we close 2 eyes). Also, they accuse Binance of intentionally relying on a confusing web of more than 120 entities in its jurisdictions globally to operate, without a global headquarters, to intentionally obscure ownership/control and avoid international regulations. Lastly - they traded against their own users. [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/01/from-hamas-warnings-to-vip-perks-and-criminal-clients-the-us-regulators-claims-against-binance) Phew. That was a helluva lot more of the bad than the good to type. So which is it? Publicly, CZ and Binance play the good guy who supports law enforcement, helps freeze accounts of hackers and even returns funds to hacked/scammed users. Privately, they're alleged (not proven, but with some pretty damning evidence) to be actively encouraging breaking US laws, allowing criminal activity on the platform, and trading against users. My guess is that this CEX has a lot of the back room dealings of other CEX's that have failed - probably not unlike the back room dealings of banks and laundering operations historically. Centralized exchanges definitely haven't come to make the world a better place - it's the same story we've heard many times before. I wouldn't use them for anything but that, exchanging, before moving my funds out. This two sidedness and strong allegations of pretty bad behavior is as good a reminder as any to self-custody and engage in Defi, rather than trusting it all to a CEX, no matter what comes of CZ and Binance.**TLRD: Binance and CZ claims to be good guys, training law enforcement in stopping crypto crimes.

Now, I understand why people don't like using Linux: it is seen as the OS for teckies and nerds who like to write a hundred lines of code just to open a browser. Well, sometimes that's the case, but Linux can be as easy to use as windows when you choose the right distribution. Linux may seem hard to use because its users like to portray themselves as kings of technlogy who can hack NASA with their terminal (even in movies Linux is glorified), but that's just like the herd mentality we have in crypto (we tend to look down on those who have less btc than we do, or those who know nothing about crypto).First of all, you need to understand that hacking Linux is much harder than hacking windows, and to simplify it, you could say that viruses actually can't exist in Linux. This doesn't mean that linux can't get hacked though, it can, but usually when its user runs compromised pieces of code in the terminal.Second, not all linux distributions are made for nerds, some like Ubuntu for example are so easy to learn and use. All you need to do is to learn the basic commands to update your system and 'upgrade it' (you'll learn what that means later on). There are websites like linuxjourney that help you learn commands in a gamified way.Finally, I get that most of you have work programs to use or want to play games, which makes windows more convinient, but you can learn how to dual-boot your system(as in install windows and linux on the same machine), or buy a cheap pc just to run linux on it (even an old laptop worth 100$ can run it smoothly).

It is a decentralized layer-2 network that enables Ethereum to scale securely and dapps to achieve unlimited scale for transactions and computation. It uses '*'*STARK proofs'*'*, a form of zero-knowledge proofs, to bundle many transactions and roll them to Ethereum as a single transaction. This way, it reduces gas fees, congestion and latency on the Ethereum network.What makes StarkNet different from other layer-2 solutions is that it is general-purpose and composable. Developers can deploy any business logic on StarkNet using Cairo, a programming language for STARK-proving general computation. They can also interact with other contracts and dapps on StarkNet, allowing for innovation and creativity. StarkNet also supports L1<>L2 communication, meaning that users can transfer funds and data between Ethereum and StarkNet seamlessly.StarkNet is still in development, but it has already achieved some impressive milestones. It has launched *Planets*, a single-app rollup that allows developers to write and prove any business logic using StarkNet contracts. It has also launched *Constellations*, a multi-app rollup that allows multiple StarkNet contracts with a single composable state. The next step is to launch *Universe*, a fully decentralized rollup that will allow anyone to run nodes, sequencers and provers on StarkNet.StarkNet has also attracted some notable partners and supporters in the crypto space. It has powered dYdX, Sorare, Immutable, [rhino.fi](https://rhino.fi), ApeX, and Canvas, among others. It has also joined forces with Chainlink Labs to accelerate StarkNet adoption and integrate Chainlink oracles into StarkNet dapps.One of the most exciting things about StarkNet is the possibility of an **airdrop** to early users. There is no official confirmation yet, but there are some hints that suggest that StarkNet might have a native token in the future. For example, the StarkNet website mentions the establishment of a StarkNet Foundation and a StarkNet first vote. These could imply some form of governance mechanism that would require a token. Also, some of the dapps on StarkNet have already announced their own tokens, such as dYdX and Immutable X. These could be used as proxies to distribute the StarkNet token to early adopters.I think StarkNet is a game-changer for Ethereum and crypto in general. It offers scalability, security, generality and composability in one package. It also has a strong team, a vibrant community and a growing ecosystem of dapps.

It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years.

I know a lot of people haven't, and I would appreciate it if you all could please quit yelling that it was a obvious scam, it wasn't. Hindsight is 20/20. The Celsius Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) is responsible for representing all unsecured creditors (which is the victims of the scam/account holders). I don't believe that this has already been posted here, and if it was, I am sorry. I copied out a small amount of the complaint. The pdf is ~280 pages long, but the complaint itself is shorter. If you have time, read about 10 pages, and it is horrific the stuff that went on at Celsius. Lies about CEL:Celsius raised capital to fund its business through an initial coin offering, or ICO, of its own cryptocurrency, the CEL token. In the summer of 2018, Alexander Mashinsky, the co- founder, director, CEO, and public face of Celsius, announced that Celsius' $50 million ICO was fully funded. It was off to the races.The ICO, however, was never fully funded. Mr. Mashinsky agreed to purchase $18 million of the CEL tokens that were not sold. But when the time came to pay, Mr. Mashinsky refused. Instead, at Mr. Mashinsky's direction, Shlomi Daniel Leon, another co-founder of Celsius, extended the time by which Mr. Mashinsky had to purchase the tokens and reduced the purchase price. Ultimately, two years later, Mr. Leon let Mr. Mashinsky off the hook, and the $18 million in CEL tokens Mr. Mashinsky promised to purchase were added back to Celsius' balance sheet.Public lies:In contrast to Mr. Mashinsky's public messaging, on the inside Celsius was a mess. Far from being safer than a bank, Celsius repeatedly failed to responsibly hold or invest the assets transferred to its platform by its account holders. In 2020, investment decisions were primarily made by Mr. Mashinsky and Harumi Urata-Thompson, Celsius' Chief Investment and Financial Officer. Those investment decisions were made in an ad hoc manner, with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency transmitted to counterparties with little to no diligence.They were tracking ~$10b of crypto on excel spreadsheets:By the spring of 2021, account holders had transferred over $10 billion of cryptocurrency to Celsius. Celsius tasked two employees with overseeing risk and sorting through the ad hoc deployments made by Mr. Mashinsky, Ms. Urata-Thompson, and other Celsius employees. To the extent Celsius tracked its billions of dollars of investments and various positions across the firm, it did so using a spreadsheet.They basically gave anyone loans with 0 due diligence, and they were unsecured üò°Mashinsky sent billions in assets to KeyFi, Inc. (KeyFi)‚Äîan entity that Mr. Mashinsky and Hanoch Nuke Goldstein partially owned‚Äîto engage in staking and speculative investments. Customer assets were sent to KeyFi before an agreement was finalized. Celsius never created proper controls or oversight mechanisms to ensure KeyFi was using its assets as directed, and Celsius is now engaged in litigation with KeyFi to recover over $200 million of losses from that transaction. Celsius also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) collateral to a separate entity, Equities First Holdings (EFH), without even receiving basic financial information from the company. EFH refused to return Celsius' BTC and now owes Celsius over $395 million.Used customer assets to pump the price of CEL:During this same period, Celsius used BTC transferred by customers to strategically purchase CEL tokens to inflate the token's price. In late 2020 and early 2021, the Defendants realized that they had not accurately tracked Celsius' assets and liabilities and, because the Defendants were using BTC to purchase CEL tokens, Celsius had significantly more BTC obligations than assets. As BTC prices skyrocketed and everyone in the crypto industry was making money, Celsius lost over $250 million‚Äîa fact that the Defendants did not realize until it was too late. After that incident, the Defendants knew that Celsius had to better track its assets and obligations‚Äîyet, the Defendants again failed to invest the proper resources into Celsius' financial operations and instead turned to another ineffective, manually updated spreadsheet, which often misrepresented Celsius' position by hundreds of millions of dollars.They somehow managed to lose billions during the bull market. The above-described loss was one of many large poor asset deployment decisions made by the Debtors in 2020 and 2021. During that time, Celsius operated at a multiple hundred million dollar loss. The returns from its investments were not sufficient to meet the bloated operating expenses incurred by the Defendants and the above-market interest rates the Defendants refused to reduce. **All told, in 2021 alone, the Defendants lost over $1.2 billion**.Insiders used customer assets to buy CEL, and then sold their own CEL to Celsius.As the losses mounted, Mr. Mashinsky, Mr. Leon, Ms. Urata-Thompson, and Mr. Treutler directed Celsius to continue spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy CEL tokens on the open market to prop up the token's price. Mr. Mashinsky, Ms. Urata-Thompson, and Mr. Johannes Treutler coordinated the timing, price, and size of purchases, each specifically intended to inflate the price of the token. As the largest holders of CEL tokens, Mr. Mashinsky, Mr. Leon, Mr. Goldstein and the other Defendants profited from the rising price. Mr. Mashinsky, Mr. Leon, and Mr. Goldstein also directly profited by secretly selling CEL tokens from their private wallets, often around the time when Celsius was purchasing CEL tokens. Between 2019 and 2022, Mr. Mashinsky sold more than $51.4 million of CEL tokens, Mr. Leon sold more than $8.6 million, and Mr. Goldstein sold more than $2.2 million. Those sales were often in direct violation of Celsius' policy on trading CEL tokens.Biggest account holder:Mr. Mashinsky would often preach that if account holders had questions about whether they should trust Celsius, they only had to look at him‚Äîthe largest account holder and CEL token holder‚Äîwho was putting his money where his mouth was and standing alongside them. Like many other things Mr. Mashinsky said to entice customers to transfer their hard-earned assets to Celsius, those statements were not true. Mr. Mashinsky refused to invest at the beginning, skimmed millions off the top through his secret sales of CEL tokens, and was the first one to jump as the Celsius ship began to sink.Here is a link to full complaint if you want to read it:https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174903312380000000001.pdf",False,"[Serious] Alex Mashisnky, Daniel Leon, Nuke, and others sued",u/[deleted],0,23,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fwf2w/serious_alex_mashisnky_daniel_leon_nuke_and/,[]

I am working on my crypto taxes (U.S.) for my 2nd year. I have thousands of transactions due to being an idiot, so my taxes are a lot of work (thousands because of all these ,01 cent staking awards and because I used to buy like $1 of BTC or 50 cents of another coin at once all year long). Anyway, this post isn't about my stupid amount of transactions, it is to hopefully be helpful to at least a few of you. So here are a few of my tips when you are running into trouble:1. Your tax software indicates that you are missing a purchase of X amount of a coin you transferred from one wallet to another, but you can't for the life of you figure out why. Check the dates and times of the transactions. I've had where one wallet's history says I bought a coin at 4PM, sent it at 4:05PM and the other wallet received it at 2:06PM. Why?  I don't know, but apparently different exchanges or wallets seem to keep time differently. So you might not really be missing a transaction for a purchase of .0002 BTC. It might just be you need to manually adjust the time. Obviously I couldn't have received a coin in one wallet about 2 hours before I sent it from another wallet.2. Double transactions. If you are finding that the API and CSV files are missing some transactions and you have tried to upload a CSV and do an API, you may have the same transaction twice or even more than twice recorded in our tax software. Since some CSV and API's aren't fully accurate, it is often challenging to figure out what is wrong. If you tried multiple times to upload a CSV in conjunctions with an API, your tax software might have added the same transaction multiple times. I also had double transactions showing on my Ledger for most of my ERC-20 deposits. I wish I had that much crypto.3. Your API and CSV are showing slightly different transactions. One says you bought X amount of a coin for an average of $55.66 and the other says an average of $55.67. I am no expert, but I've found that it seems usually the API is right. 4. Your tax software says you sold or transferred coins it has no record of you buying. Well, number 1 above is one possibility, but another is wrong API or CSV again. I had a couple of transactions where I had bought a coin on a CEX and the CEX had a record of my selling said coin instead of buying it. You will need to simply change this on your taxes from a sale to a purchase. 5. For some wallets you may need to actually create multiple wallets for the same coin to record transactions. Example---you are staking AVAX using the native wallet. You may need to create an Avalanche P-Chain Wallet and an Avalanche P-Chain Staking Wallet in order to account for staking transactions (especially fees).That's all of my tips for right now, Maybe I'll post more later. I'm already working on recording my 2023 transactions in my crypto tax software so I can more easily troubleshoot and to make my life easier in 2024 when I do my 2023 taxes. Hopefully, I keep up with it. Hope this helped at least 1 or 2 people.

He recruited Steve Wozniak with the assistance of the DEA and FBI by planting a boatload of LSD on Woz and threatening to throw him in jail for life if he did not work for the feds like a slave.The success of Apple is not the result of a successful marketing campaign but the government buying enough product to create the appearance of a #1 company.  Apple products are actually crap but we've been brainwashed into thinking that Apple is the best by social media (think Facebook). u/Acc10810 reminded me of the very important fact that the NSA created Facebook and still runs it to this day.  Mark Zuckerberg is actually a robot controlled by the NSA. The Japanese, who are at the forefront of robotics, helped the NSA build the robot and still updates it every year or two. If you look at Zuckerberg's photos, you will notice slight differences between each version of the robot. With the funding assistance of the CIA, Jobs created and used Apple as a cover to hire a teamof highly skilled developers and advisors from the financial services sector to develop the bitcoin codebase and write the white paper.  So Satoshi Nakamoto was not an individual but a code name for an elite fintech software development team.  Woz only developed the Apple tech as a front to the overall bitcoin operations. The circumstances of his employment meant that he could never reveal why he stayed working with Jobs for as long as he did.The CIA link can be found in the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto loosely translated from Japanese is central intelligence. We also keep hearing about Facebook's continued multibillion dollar investments into the metaverse that haven't materialized into anything. This is because that money is being used to help prop up Apple sales.  One reason for needing this revenue stream is because the FBI is running low on confiscated drug cartel money.

Apart from this, SEC head Gary Gensler has wavered back and forth over several months, proclaiming conflicting statements that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities and not securities, all coins and tokens are securities, and only Bitcoin is a commodity in order of chronology. However, the CFTC has taken a opposing stance to this.In the suit against Binance, the CFTC declared Bitcoin, Ethereum and BUSD to be commodities, not securities, directly in opposition to previous SEC statements. In addition, the CFTC also declared Tether and Litecoin as well as a number of other unnamed tokens to be commodities. While it is good that there is some amount of 'regulatory fairness' in the CFTC pushback,the whole situation in a way worse than the SEC simply giving something like a declaration that only Bitcoin is a security. Although I understand the majority of it is due solely to the SEC because of their refusal for clear regulations and their regulations by enforcement.The thing is, even if all tokens were declared as securities, at least companies could set up themselves to be in line with securities regulations and function without harassment and threats from regulators. As it is now, companies don't know if to go under securities regulations or function as if it were commodities. In such conditions, companies simply cannot make investments to improve their products and services for customers else risk a big fine(s), hits to reputation and big losses in the future.

The crypto market is constantly changing, so it's important to stay up to date on the latest regulations and tax laws. In this thread, we will discuss the best strategies for minimizing your crypto taxes in 2023.## Moving to a Taxpayer-Friendly StateAs a crypto investor, moving to a more taxpayer-friendly state is one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax burden legally. While the federal government imposes taxes on cryptocurrency transactions like any other investment, states have unique tax laws that can significantly impact your overall liability. Some states have no state income tax, meaning any income (such as staking, hard forks) and capital gains would be state-tax-free. When you consider that state taxes can be as high as 10.9% in New York or 13.3% in California, it's easy to see how moving to a more taxpayer-friendly state can significantly impact your after-tax wealth. The same investor facing a 23.8% tax rate on long-term Bitcoin gains in Florida could see up to a 37.1% rate in California.States without Income TaxStates without income tax include include Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming. Washington does not have a state income tax, although the state enacted a capital-gains tax effective for tax years starting in 2022; this tax is currently being challenged as unconstitutional, leaving taxpayers uncertain about the taxation of capital gains going forward. New Hampshire also has odd laws as it only taxes interest and dividends; the state imposes a tax on residents whose interest and dividend income exceeds $2,400 during the taxable year ($4,800 if they file jointly).## Moving to Puerto RicoFor crypto investors looking to minimize their tax burden, Puerto Rico has emerged as an attractive destination with unique tax incentives. The island territory offers new residents a range of tax benefits, including a 0% tax rate on capital gains and a 4% corporate tax rate for certain types of businesses. Yes, that is a 0% rate on capital gains! Keep in mind that gains will be taxed by the federal government up until the point of qualifying as a Puerto Rico resident, so while you can't evade the unrealized gains you are sitting on today, you can still avoid taxation if you do this before your coins go to the moon.## Buying Crypto in a Retirement AccountOne of the most effective strategies for crypto investors looking to avoid taxes is to buy cryptocurrency as part of a retirement account. Retirement accounts, such as self-directed IRAs, allow investors to potentially avoid capital gains taxes on their crypto investments while providing tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Investing in crypto through a retirement account can also offer asset protection and estate planning benefits.Self-directed IRAs, in particular, allow investors to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies. This means that investors can potentially benefit from crypto gains without triggering capital gains taxes until they withdraw the funds from the account. While not all IRA providers offer the option to invest in crypto, several self-directed IRA custodians such as iTrustCapital, Bitcoin IRA, and Coin IRA offer this option.## Selling Coins in Years of Lower IncomeOne strategy for crypto investors looking to minimize their tax liability is to sell their coins in years of lower income. This is because the capital gain tax rates are based on the investor's income bracket in a given year ‚Äì that's right, the higher your ordinary tax rates, the higher your capital gain rates. If taxable income is under $44,625 ($89,250 married filing jointly), then any capital gains included in that amount will be taxed at 0%. Investors can pay a lower tax rate on their gains by taking profits in a year when personal income is low.## Tax Loss HarvestingMany of the previous strategies require you to relocate physically or to invest your assets into accounts that you'll not be able to liquidate (without penalties) until retirement years. However, every investor can use the single most effective strategy for minimizing their tax liability when it comes to cryptocurrency investments ‚Äì tax loss harvesting. The strategy involves selling off investments that have lost value to offset the tax liability of your gains. This can be an incredibly valuable tool for cryptocurrency investors who have suffered significant losses in the market and want to reduce their overall tax burden.Please check out the [full guide](https://hub.accointing.com/crypto-tax-regulations/usa/avoid-crypto-taxes-legally) for more information or put your questions below so we can review your specific case and get back to you asap!Stay awesome,Max from Accointing by Glassnode",False,How to Legally Minimize Crypto Taxes in 2023,u/[deleted],0,1,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fj0rk/how_to_legally_minimize_crypto_taxes_in_2023/,[]

Off the back of a single leaked Alameda balance sheet that may have never come to light save not for that leak, FTX's deep manipulation and fraud was revealed. Meanwhile, and otherwise, millions used FTX without a car in the world.FTX was again another pitfall because it revealed how blindly many trusted exchanges, simply assuming funds would be accessible perpetually. Many heard of even parroted not your keys but seemingly few took it to heart.Then we come to today with these banking failures, where billions around the globe trusted banks even after 2008, suddenly realized that just because banks are a government-backed federally-insured Ponzi, doesn't change the fact that it is still a Ponzi.

But new users don't have tokens. To solve this, many crypto projects make a faucet to give users small amounts of starter coins. The problem is that any given user may come back more than once ('faucet addiction') and while you can discourage this with time delays, captchas, and other techniques, it will not prevent it entirely. Eventually you are left in a race between the value of the coins the faucet dispenses and how much somebody values their time or the difficulty to obtain the coins.So I set out to solve this problem with a new faucet design. This new faucet is a 'proof of work' faucet. First we figure out how much work would typically need to be done to earn x amount of coins with normal mining, then we make sure the amount of work we require to be done to use the faucet is above that amount. And unlike hashes, which are boring and *so* 2014, this uses credits from BOINC projects. BOINC is a permissionless network which uses the computers of volunteers to crunch data for scientific researchers. There are projects ranging from medical research to finding pulsars. The Large Hadron Collider even has a project. And there is a crypto project (Gridcoin) which rewards BOINC participation, so we have a 'ruler' to establish how much BOINC computation it takes to earn $X USD in coins. The faucet is one time use and bans the user id/CPID after the first use. **Importantly, the amount of work required means that a person would make more coins mining normally than creating new accounts for the sole purpose of using the faucet, so there is is a disincentive to use the faucet multiple times**.Right now, this faucet only works for Gridcoin, but it could easily be extended to support any other coin where a relationship of value can be established between GRC and that coin. It connects to the Gridcoin wallet via the same web RPC that Bitcoin's wallet uses. The faucet pulls BOINC stats from World Community Grid and NFS@Home (but again, can be used with any other BOINC project you just need to make a few minor changes). Making all those customizations could be done in less than 20 lines of code, and examples are provided for you to do it.It's written in python and open source, you are free to use it on your project, I hope some other people find it useful. It can be a cool way to **get starter coins for your users** (especially for blockchains which have no mining as an option) and **support scientific research** at the same time. It also doesn't require your users to install typical mining software via the command line or some other complex route, BOINC is much easier to use.[https://github.com/makeasnek/ScienceStatsFaucet](https://github.com/makeasnek/ScienceStatsFaucet)",False,I made a new faucet design which helps avoid 'faucet addiction' and you can use it for your crypto project,u/[deleted],0,8,0.65,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fij4b/i_made_a_new_faucet_design_which_helps_avoid/,[]

I have some practical advice for that person and others in this sub with large Moon bags when they decide to sell. Evidently, I have a needle dick bag, so it is not something I need to worry about.Because Moons are not on a major CEX and liquidity is still relatively limited, you need to be careful when offloading a large bag into a stable coin. If you look to sell a large bag of Moons in one go, you could end up eating a lot of slippage if you sell in a market order. Instead of $1m that you should have earned, you could be walking away with something considerably less than that. This happens all the time - not a remote risk.If your holding a large bag of a coin and that coin is listed on a major CEX, you can convert that bag into a stable coin at the price you want using using limit orders on Binance / Coinbase etc. If it is not listed on a CEX, like Moons right now, you do not have a way of exiting into stables through traditional limit orders. You therefore have two options to avoid slippage: (1) good old DCA out - but by doing so you're at risk of averaging down below the price you wanted to sell at, or (2) sell through single sided liquidity providing on Uniswap, which effectively allows you to sell your Moons into stables at a specific price (explained below).Normally, liquidity providers put a pair of coins into a liquidity pool (e.g., Moons / USDC), with a view to earning a fee for the service. In single side liquidity providing, providers only put one of the coins in, and can set the price at which they wish the Moons to be sold at (just like limit orders on an Exchange, or when swapping between non-stable crypto on a DEX). So, as and when someone buys your Moons through the liquidity pool, they are depositing USDC with you at the ratio you decided. This is what the Whales do, and it is what I would recommend big Moon holders do when the time comes, if Moons are still not listed on a major CEX. Not only does it allow you to sell at the price you want, but it is better for other Moon holders as it avoids tanking the price in the market when you exit - you're not dumping everything at once when there isn't enough buy-side demand to support the price.Hope this helps some.

Security: Centralized exchanges are a popular target for hackers due to the large amounts of cryptocurrency they hold. By storing cryptocurrency in a cold wallet, you can reduce the risk of having your funds stolen by criminals.2. Control: When you hold your cryptocurrency on an exchange, you are essentially entrusting a third party with your funds. By using a cold wallet, you have complete control over your cryptocurrency and can manage it as you see fit.3. The SEC and other jurisdictions are strongarming CEX's at the moment.

If a scammer has it, they'll steal your Moons.*# 2. Install MetaMaskInstall MetaMask from [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/).Click 'Import Wallet' (not 'create new wallet') and paste your seed phrase from step 1 there.*Now you control your Reddit vault address through a MetaMask wallet.*# 3. Deposit ETH to your MetaMask addressGo to your favorite CEX (centralized exchange, such as Kraken) and buy some ETH.Withdraw it to your MetaMask address (format: 0x...).If your exchange supports withdrawals to Arbitrum One besides Ethereum mainnet, it will be even cheaper. If you're not sure what this means, just withdraw to your Ethereum address.*Now, you have ETH on your MetaMask, either in Ethereum mainnet or Arbitrum One. Don't worry about it 'not appearing in your MM wallet'.*# 4. Bridge your ETH to Arbitrum NovaGo to [https://www.orbiter.finance/](https://www.orbiter.finance/) to bridge the ETH to Arbitrum Nova.Arbitrum Nova is where your Moons are.*Note: Arbitrum One is not the same as Arbitrum Nova. If you don't know what this means, just ignore it.*On Orbiter Finance, do the following:1. Select the network you're bridging **from** (it will be either Ethereum or Arbitrum, depends on where you withdrew in step 3)2. Select Arbitrum Nova for the network you're bridging **to**.Click send and confirm. *Note: MetaMask might ask you to add some network on this step, just approve everything.**At the end of this step, you will have ETH on Arbitrum Nova, ready to be put in liquidity pool with your Moons.*# 5. Add Arbitrum Nova to MetaMaskGo to [https://www.sushi.com/swap](https://www.sushi.com/swap).In the header there is a dropdown with Ethereum pre-selected. Select Arbitrum Nova. This will add the network to your MetaMask wallet. Just approve that and click on 'Switch Network'.# 6. Provide LiquidityGo to Earn.In the search bar, type 'moon'. Click on the ETH/MOON pool.Click deposit and enter the amounts you want to stake (**more details on this below**).Add liquidity and then click on the 'stake liquidity'.Confirm everything MetaMask asks you to confirm.Congratulations!# FAQ: How much Moons should you provide in LP?There is currently a rule that you must hold 75% of your earned Moons to avoid earning less on the next Moon distributions.This means that you shouldn't add more than 25% of your Moons to liquidity.So if you have 2000 Moons, you can provide up to 500 without having penalties for next distributions.# FAQ: How much Ethereum do you need?After you figure out how much Moons you want to use, you'll need the equivalent dollar amount in Ethereum.So if you ended up with 500 Moons for liquidity in the first step, with MOON == '~$0.2, that's '~$100. So you need the equivalent amount of ETH to pool with.I'd advise adding '~$20 more in ETH because there are gas fees you need to pay. They won't be that high, but I always consider it a good practice to have a bit more ETH just in case.So TLDR: if you LP with $100 worth of MOON, deposit '~$120 worth of ETH in your wallet.# FAQ: It's clear, but how do I understand bridging better?I already have a post about the details behind bridging over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fdmcz/explained'_what'_is'_bridging'_and'_how'_does'_it'_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fdmcz/explained_what_is_bridging_and_how_does_it_work/)You don't need to read it to follow this guide, but if you're interested, feel free to learn more!# FAQ: I've heard about impermanent loss, should I take it into consideration?I also have a post about impermanent loss over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dducc/impermanent'_loss'_simple'_explanation'_liquidity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dducc/impermanent_loss_simple_explanation_liquidity/)It's good to educate yourself about it, but it's not that 'scary' as many make it to be.# FAQ: How much will the gas fees be when bridging from Ethereum mainnet?If you bridge from Ethereum mainnet, it should be somewhere between $4-8, depending on how busy the network is. Accept that you'll 'lose' $10 in fees and you're good.But if you bridge from Arbitrum One to Arbitrum Nova, it will be less than a dollar. In any case, MetaMask will tell you the maximum fee and you can Approve or Reject the transaction.# TLDR for Intermediate Users1. Initialize a new MetaMask with your vault's seed phrase2.

The data shows that investors' confidence in Bitcoin has grown, with the cryptocurrency successfully passing an extreme liquidity stress test during a US banking crisis.The experts' research reveals that for a significant majority of cryptocurrency investors, Bitcoin remains a base asset that protects against major risks. The asset's market value has grown rapidly in the first quarter of 2023, and the trust in its network, based on hashrate, confirms analysts' conclusions about the potential dominance of Bitcoin as a global reserve asset.Despite increasing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market caused by the record increase in Fed rates, a liquidity crisis in the US banking system, and subsequent depositor exodus, Bitcoin remained an attractive investment throughout the first quarter of 2023, with its value rising over 20%.Against the backdrop of financial turbulence, Bitcoin has demonstrated its potential as a hedge against instability in the banking system, according to analysts.>'As central banks and regulatory authorities try to build trust in reserve-based banking, the Bitcoin network's decentralized and distributed nodes, miners, and users organically become thicker. Doubling the hashrate during the bear trend in 2022, combined with an exceptional start to 2023, is truly impressive,' the Bloomberg Intelligence report said.Bloomberg Intelligence also believes that the Bitcoin blockchain network has never been as secure as it is now. The significant increase in hashrate, which has risen by 25% since the beginning of the year, indicates that overall trust in the network is at an all-time high.Experts at Bloomberg explain that hashrate refers to the computational power of the network used to process and verify Bitcoin blockchain transactions. The higher the hashrate, the more difficult it is for a single entity to control the network or manipulate transaction history.

You can have USDC on Ethereum, on Arbitrum, on Binance Smart Chain, etc.If your (centralized) exchange only accepts USDC deposits on the BSC network, and you send USDC from your wallet connected to the Ethereum network, the funds may never arrive. Actually, this is a mistake that many newbies do before they understand networks/chains.Another example, let's say there is a new token you're interested. For illustration purposes, let's say that's GMX, that's only available on the Arbitrum network. So you can't simply swap your ETH from Ethereum mainnet into it.In both scenarios described above, you need **a bridge**.# What is Bridging (in Crypto)?Bridging means transferring a digital asset from one network to another.Once you understand the problems it solves, the explanation is much simpler. :)# How to Bridge Assets?There are various bridges available and you'll need to use the one that suits your needs (supports the networks and the asset you want to bridge).My top 2 picks for this moment are:* **Stargate Finance**: [https://stargate.finance/transfer](https://stargate.finance/transfer)* **Orbiter Finance**: [https://www.orbiter.finance/](https://www.orbiter.finance/?source=Ethereum&dest=Arbitrum)You simply connect your MetaMask and select:1. The network you're bridging from2. The network you're bridging to3. The asset you want to bridgeClick send and within 5 minutes, your assets will arrive on the other side.*Edit: Note: There are many other bridges, and most networks have their dedicated bridges, but the 2 above are general purpose.**One such example is zkSync - if you want to use their bridge, you can do it on* [*https://bridge.zksync.io/*](https://bridge.zksync.io/)*. The only downside is that it might cost you $5-10 in ETH gas fees, but it* ***might*** *make you eligible for an airdrop worth multiples of that in the future.*# ConclusionIf you've read so far, all your questions are now answered.Now, whether you were confused about which network to initiate a withdrawal from a CEX, or how to use some coin on a network you're unfamiliar about, it should be clarified.So, in the case for **providing liquidity for Moons**:1. Bridge your ETH to Arbitrum Nova using Orbiter Finance (link above)2. Go to SushiSwap and add to the ETH/MOON poolIt's as easy as that!**Edit: if you need a detailed instructions on providing Moon liquidity, I just published this post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12ff2bu/providing'_liquidity'_for'_moons'_made'_easy'_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12ff2bu/providing_liquidity_for_moons_made_easy_explained/)Happy DeFi adventures!",False,"Explained: What is Bridging and How Does it Work?

And ever since then, airdrops seem to have a trend.Just a day after the ARB airdrop, zkSync Network saw it's launch. There have been many articles discussing how to be eligible for a potential $10,000 airdrop on the platform. zkSync was then caught up in the scandal as more than $1.7M of the users' ETH got frozen due to developers' laziness in not testing their contracts.Moreover, when asked, zkSync denies any future airdrops.I recently came across  a video by the youtuber Conner Kenny telling his viewers to get ready for a massive SUI airdrop, however, the commentors on the video noted that thale developers on SUI discord have, once again, denied any possibility of an airdrop. Not only that, even the word airdrop has been banned on their discord due to the massive amounts of misinformation.Now, you can trust a random commentor under a youtube video just as much as you can trust the youtuber, by that I mean: not at all. There are some people that are speculating the devs are just lying to the users as they want to keep it a secret, so believe what you want to.So why are these airdrop rumours spreading for not only one but multiple tokens? Is it from people riding regretting missing out on the ARB train? Are the developers the ones using the ARB hype and trying to popularise their platforms then denying the rumours so that they won't actually have to pay up?

Most countries are planning  to implement CBDCs very soon. Kings and queens never went away. It is the corporations and the ultra rich elites who really control our governments. They keep us divided while the wealth gap grows  and they become richer.So my question is this. If the entire world is moving towards CBDCs for their countries, how will decentralized crypto continue to exist?

The consensus behind this was that decentralized blockchain technology is for the people by the people.Obviously I don't need to spell out what decentralized technology is. So one first questions I posed for chat gbt was this.Would you agree that decentralized blockchain technology is for the people by the people? Chat gbt response: Decentralized blockchain technology is designed to be trustless and permissionless, which means that it can be used by anyone without the need for a centralized authority or intermediary. This can help to democratize access to financial services, data storage, and other applications that were previously controlled by a small group of gatekeepers.In this sense, it can be argued that decentralized blockchain technology is for the people by the people. By removing the need for centralized control, blockchain technology can give individuals and communities more control over their own assets, data, and identity.However, it's important to note that not all blockchain projects are created equal, and some may be more centralized or controlled by a small group of individuals or organizations. Additionally, while blockchain technology has the potential to promote greater decentralization and democratization, it's not a silver bullet solution to all societal issues. There are still challenges and limitations that need to be addressed, such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory issues, before blockchain can fully realize its potential as a tool for the people.I responded: In todays world where everything is centralized concerning like peoples own assets data and identity. What would be some major effects of most things being more decentralized in that aspect? What centralized companies or governments would be effected if any. How will it reshape our culture. Chat gbt response: If more aspects of our lives, such as our assets, data, and identity, were decentralized, it would have a significant impact on both individuals and institutions. Here are a few potential effects:Increased privacy: Decentralization can help to improve privacy by giving individuals more control over their own data and identity. With decentralized systems, users can choose which data they want to share, and with whom.Disintermediation: Decentralization can remove the need for intermediaries, such as banks, governments, or tech companies, that currently control access to financial services, data, and identity verification. This could lead to more competition, innovation, and lower costs.Greater security: Decentralized systems can be more secure than centralized systems because there is no single point of failure or attack. Distributed networks can prevent data breaches and other forms of cyber attacks that are common in centralized systems.Cultural shifts: Decentralization could also lead to cultural shifts in how we think about ownership, trust, and power. For example, if individuals have more control over their own assets, data, and identity, they may be less reliant on centralized institutions for their needs.In terms of who would be affected by decentralization, it would depend on the specific industry and use case. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) could disrupt traditional banks and financial institutions, while decentralized social networks could challenge the dominance of tech giants like Facebook and Twitter.Overall, decentralization has the potential to reshape our culture and society in significant ways. It could lead to greater individual empowerment, increased innovation and competition, and more privacy and security. However, it's important to address the challenges and limitations of decentralized systems, such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance, to ensure that they can deliver on their promises.My response: How can we achieve the needs of scalability interoperability and regulatory compliance. Gie me a very detailed quantitative analysis of these areas in more detail.Chat gbt response: Scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance are three key challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the full potential of decentralized systems. Here's a detailed quantitative analysis of each of these areas:Scalability: Scalability is a major challenge in decentralized systems, particularly in the context of blockchain. The number of transactions that can be processed on a blockchain is limited by the size of the blocks and the speed of consensus. As the number of users and transactions on a blockchain grows, it becomes more difficult to achieve consensus and maintain the security of the network.To address this challenge, there are several potential solutions, including sharding, off-chain transactions, and layer 2 scaling solutions. Sharding involves breaking the blockchain into smaller 'shards' that can be processed in parallel, while off-chain transactions involve moving transactions off the main blockchain to reduce congestion. Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, involve creating secondary payment channels that can process transactions off-chain.Interoperability: Interoperability is the ability of different decentralized systems to communicate and share data with each other. In order to achieve true decentralization, it's important for different blockchains and decentralized applications (dApps) to be able to interoperate.One potential solution for interoperability is the use of interoperability protocols, such as Polkadot and Cosmos, that aim to connect different blockchain networks. Another approach is the use of cross-chain bridges, which allow different blockchain networks to exchange data and assets.Regulatory Compliance: Regulatory compliance is a challenge for decentralized systems because they operate outside of traditional regulatory frameworks. However, as decentralized systems become more widely adopted, there is a growing need for them to comply with existing regulations and standards.To address this challenge, there are several potential solutions, including the development of regulatory frameworks specifically for decentralized systems, such as the proposed Digital Asset Framework by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Another approach is to use regulatory-compliant decentralized systems, such as security tokens, that are designed to comply with existing securities regulations.In conclusion, addressing the challenges of scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance is essential for the continued growth and adoption of decentralized systems. There are several potential solutions for each of these challenges, including sharding, off-chain transactions, interoperability protocols, cross-chain bridges, regulatory frameworks, and regulatory-compliant decentralized systems. However, there is still much work to be done in these areas to ensure that decentralized systems can deliver on their promises of greater privacy, security, and decentralization.",False,Open discussion on this analysis,u/[deleted],0,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12f4smb/open_discussion_on_this_analysis/,[]

This law requires financial institutions to carry out due diligence on their customers to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.The extension of the PMLA to include cryptocurrency transactions is a step towards regulating cryptocurrencies in India. This move allegedly will help prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing, which have been a concern for the Indian government.As you might suspect, the increased regulation could also stifle innovation in the cryptocurrency industry, as new startups will find it harder to enter the market in India due to the costs associated with compliance. Additionally, the increased scrutiny could lead to delays in transactions and higher fees for investors, which could discourage individuals from investing in or using cryptocurrencies.TL;DR: In short, excessive regulation could soon start to hinder the growth and development of the crypto industry in the most populous place on earth.Seeing as governments around the world seem hellbent on building regulatory infrastructure for crypto, what reasonable steps do we think that governments can take to strike a balance between regulating cryptocurrencies and promoting innovation in the industry while not shutting out average people from the crypto space?",False,An interesting update on crypto regulations in India,u/[deleted],0,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12f4dxj/an_interesting_update_on_crypto_regulations_in/,[]

But that doesn't change the fact that Musk is a egotistical manic who cares little about anyone else. On Money, dogecoin pumped 25% and then dumped giving back much of the gains before rebounding again. There were about 20M in both long and short liquidations as shorts were liquidated when the price went up, and longs when the price dumped. All because Musk changed the Twitter logo to the dogecoin logo. And of course as of today, Twitter changed the logo back to the original Twitter logo, as he had no plans of implementing doge as a currency and it was just a big joke by him while desperate investors and/or greedy fools lose their hard-earned money if not life savings.

Credit goes to u/brojinacusThere's a shift in the force, we need more eyes on thisI recently came into awareness of the FedNow program, and it led me down a rabbit hole. There's something going on in the US Treasury. I can't quite put it to words, but we need more eyes on this. Recently, the federal debt clock changed it's calculation from 'federal reserve dollars' to 'US Treasury dollars'. That's a small but significant shift in wording. Usdebtclock.org gets it's api info directly from the US Treasury. There has also been a global exit from the US dollar as a global reserve currency. I think that's because the actual US dollar is changing definitions right under our noses. Try to follow:The federal reserve controls paper money. Congress controls the federal reserve. The US Treasury is rolling out FedNow, which is going to incorporate a digital dollar. This will render the federal reserve useless and greatly affect congresses ability to affect monetary policy. Secretary of treasury made announcements on March 28 and March 30 hinting at a solution to the United States financial problems. On April 6th the US Treasury announced a strategic operating plan. Page 80 is particularly interesting. Executive branch also issued funds to the IRS for new hires. I think Fednow is that proposed solution, and the IRS will run Fednow and roll out the United States digital dollar through it. And they will be able to view all of our finances, and halt purchases in an instant. For any reason. Edit: I also found an interesting document from the US Treasury titled 'Description of extraordinary measures'. I think line item 1.B. is important One time measure available last day of June.

I have a gaming PC, an android degoogled phone and a chromebook.I use fedora OS with full disk encryption for my gaming/daily use pcI use chromebook for banking and crypto because it has secure boot and verified boot and secure out of box (after updates)I use a vpn if im on a public wifi connection i try to avoid public of course, but if you do use a public wifi you absolutely must use a vpn before logging into your accounts!!!I use keepassXC to store passwords and recovery keys, but i dont use it for 2ffa I use my phone for 2ffa only using the app Aegis not SMS i do not login to my bank or crypto on my phone ever this way i have device isolation for my 2ffa and my passwordsKeep all devices updated and practice smart browsing habits to keep them cleanNow your router and modem: please tell me you have researched how to secure your router because most of them do not come secure at all, this can get advanced but it does not need toLogin to your router and set strong user name and password at least, turn off wps, make sure firewall is on and no ports are open ect ect, turn on device isolation if thats an optionNow for DNS:DNS is extremely powerful and highly overlooked aspect of security and privacyYou can set your custom DNS in your router or in your browser or bothI recommend simple copy and paste of quad 9 DNS provider into the settings page of your router or browser, you can follow the instructions on the quad9 siteFor more advanced users i recommended Dnscrypt proxy v2 for full dns encryption on an openwrt router DNS protection from quad9 will filter out scam websites using dnssec and blocklist preventing alot of crypto scams and man in the middle attacks and they respect your privacy unlike your default DNSUse a hardened browser:Ublock is an absolute must have, update the block lists and enable no script if you want and then whitelist sites you need java on ectThen i also use the extensions canvasblocker and skip redirect and smart referThe gold standard is arkenfox for firefox, or librewolf browser, use multiple browers just like multiple devices this will help protect youI will finish this by mentioning other rules you should be aware of:Dont tell people you own cryptoDont goto bad sites that offer hot local women near youDont open random emailsDown download and install shit use the app storesDont use weak passwords or repeat them or talk about them outloud or write them down learn to use keepassXC Dont use public wifiDont leave your devices powered on when unattended everBookmark sites so you have the correct linkHave a plan for when someone comes for your cryptoFor those who do read i hope this was helpful in some way, i should also mention the WEF has planned out a massive world wide cyber attack they have been warning us about, now is the time to upgrade your security amd disconnect what you can, crazy times ahead for sureEDIT: YES!!!! An airgapped hardware wallet is the most secure way anyone can store crypto!!!! Yes i agree, but can you agree that first you have to buy the crypto and safely transfer it?????

Would such strategy be possible with Crypto considering the volatility?

Starknet and zkSync Lite (non-EVM) were among the earliest L2s launched, but they never gained much activity compared to Arbitrum One and Optimism, which are EVM-compatible. There's a 50x difference in TVL between EVM and non-EVM L2 networks.Taiko's team split from Loopring in early 2022 and have been developing their own zkEVM since. When this happened, many Loopring holders complained about the developmental 'rugpull' because they thought the Taiko team was going to help develop Loopring into a zkEVM. A year later, any hopes of zkEVM on Loopring have vanished.## The current state of LoopringLoopring's mobile wallet app supports Taiko's A-2 Testnet, but the browser app doesn't support it yet.Loopring's network will remain as an L2 on Ethereum, but it could also move onto Taiko's network as a L3 in the future and gain reduced fees. It will never have EVM-support, so application development would be limited on it.Personally, I feel like Taiko is cannibalizing the Loopring network. It's just so much easier to develop on an EVM network with Solidity and hardhat than it is to use a proprietary-code network like Loopring.## Using the Taiko TestnetThis is actually their 2nd testnet. I gave it a trial. You can follow [https://taiko.xyz/docs/guides](https://taiko.xyz/docs/guides)**Using Metamask**To use it on Metamask, you have to do a lot of setup, and their bridge is slow. It took 2 hours to bridge over from Sepolia to Taiko A-2.Their bridge app is buggy. It doesn't auto-update and fails to switch networks smoothly. The gas fee estimator is also asking for 1000x more gas. But it's in alpha testing, so that's fine for now assuming they fix these soon.Afterwards, your transaction will need to be picked up by a relayer to auto-claim it for the A-2 network. This took my account 2 hours.[Taiko bridge app](https://preview.redd.it/sel70mdyqhsa1.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c53d14709aa303d0839b99f1570e9819200e76c6)**Using the Loopring mobile Wallet app**This was easier than the desktop app, but there's no Horse or BLL faucet.* You have to create a new account.* Select Taiko as the network.* Then press the Activate button, which sends you 0.1 testnet ETH* You can then send and receive tokens* Guardians: You can set multiple guardians for your wallet. My requests are still pending after an hour.* You can also set 2FA via authenticator (or SMS/email). SMS and email are ok for test accounts, but don't use them on a real account.## First Impressions* **The web app is buggy.*** Transfers are super-slow. I tried sending from each of my test wallest to each other. 30 minutes later, they were still pending. This is unacceptably slow for any Ethereum network, especially for an L2. This network is currently unusable. A bit embarrassing considering that this is their 2nd testnet.* I can't imagine why this testnet would be stalling given there it's only getting 10-20 transactions per minute. It must be a network-wide bug.* The Taiko A-2 Explorer looks a lot like Arbitrum Nova's first explorer (now deprecated). That's a good thing because at least it's familiar.Assuming they fix the bugs and it's actually fully-EVM compatible, this would likely cannibalize the Loopring network. I suspect Loopring devs are already prepared to gradually migrate their apps onto the Taiko network.Loopring's success is more than just their network's success. It's also their die-hard community. Even if they migrate to Taiko in the future, their apps could very well do even better without the original Loopring network.----------------------**Edit - I found out why it's unbearably slow:****Tx Mempool [has](https://status.a2.taiko.xyz/) 6700 pending Transactions and 1700 queued Txs. The whole blockchain is operating at 0.5 TPS due to a design flaw**From their blog:> There is a design flaw in our protocol economics. When blocks are proposed with fixed intervals, the prover rewards will monotonically increase, and now it has reached an untenably high value. If we had kept the block time short, the reward amount will eventually have overflown, and the chain would have halted.> To prevent that, we had to slow down block proposal (proposal interval of 20 seconds) while working on patching the aforementioned contract flaw/bug. Slowed block times then led to a congested mempool and degradation in user experience that manifested itself in the form of long delays for bridge or pending wallet transactions (Reminder: in alpha-2, we have a single proposer and decentralized provers, the inverse of alpha-1.)Alpha-2 is being replaced by Alpha-3 in Q2.",False,"The Taiko A-2 testnet launch, and what that means for the future of Loopring",u/[deleted],0,3,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12erbqu/the_taiko_a2_testnet_launch_and_what_that_means/,[]

Polygon is moving from a side-chain to a true L2 and I expect others to do the same over time and new names to enter. There's not going to be enough ETH for projects to work on the layer1 directly, they'll basically be forced to a layer 2 for speed, and price, and that layer 2 will rent ETH's security.

Let's take a look.  Malicious actors stole over $320 million of value from Web3 protocols across 207 separate incidents in Q1 2023. This represents just over a third of the $950 million lost in Q4, and a quarter of the $1.3 billion lost in Q1 2022.  Just one incident ‚Äì the Euler Finance exploit at $197 million ‚Äì represented over 60% of all value lost in Q1. This highlights the asymmetrical rewards on offer for successful exploits of large protocols.  Off-chain, Q1 has seen some significant events for the crypto industry. From the shuttering of Silvergate Bank, one of the industry's strongest links to the traditional finance industry, to the weekend de-pegging of USDC during the Silicon Valley Bank tumult. It's been an eventful quarter, but that's nothing new for crypto.  The Euler Finance Incident was the most significant of Q1.  Euler Finance is a non-custodial protocol on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow almost any crypto asset. On 13 March, an attacker utilized flash loans to exploit multiple Euler Finance pools. They walked away with a total profit of approximately $197 million. This incident alone more than doubles the total lost to all other security incidents in Web3 during the first quarter of 2023.  Euler's vulnerability lay within the '`donateToReserves'` function in the Euler Pool contracts. This function lacks proper checking of the liquidity collateralization status, with the result being that a user can willingly abandon a portion of the leveraged deposit to leave the pool insolvent.  Using 20 million DAI obtained via a flash loan from Aave, the attacker created a highly leveraged position through the '`mint'` function of the Euler lending protocol. The Mint function allows a user to create a recursive lending loop, minting equity and debt tokens, depositing the equity tokens, and then borrowing against them.  The attacker deposited the 20 million DAI and leveraged the Mint function to increase their position size ten times, to 200 million. They then repaid 10 million, which allowed them to leverage up again with another 200 million eDAI tokens. By donating 100 million eDAI to the protocol, using the vulnerable donateToReserves' function, the attacker's position was pushed into the liquidation range. They then liquidated their own position and received the 20% bonus as per the functioning of the Euler platform. 2 weeks after the attack, the exploiter returned a large chunk of the funds. Transferring 55,000 ETH worth over $85M. While it is unclear exactly on what the terms of the agreement with Euler were, there is a good chance the users will be made partially or completely whole again.Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAgLdGl56CE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAgLdGl56CE)Further reading: [https://cointelegraph.com/news/euler-team-denies-on-chain-sleuth-was-a-suspect-in-hack-case](https://cointelegraph.com/news/euler-team-denies-on-chain-sleuth-was-a-suspect-in-hack-case)",False,"Certik report on the Euler hack, which made up most of the Q1/2023 hack losses",u/[deleted],0,1,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12em69u/certik_report_on_the_euler_hack_which_made_up/,[]

Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to  crypto wallets. Different wallets offer different levels of security and  convenience, and it's up to the individual to decide which wallet is  best for them. To help educate people on the different types of wallets  available, this chapter will provide a brief overview of the most common  wallets used for storing cryptocurrencies. It will also provide advice  on how to choose a wallet and how to keep it secure. I hope you like it  my friends.**Hardware Wallet**:The  most secure type of wallet is a Hardware Wallet. These wallets are  physical devices that store your coins in an offline environment, making  them much more difficult to hack. They are also quite convenient, as  they usually support multiple coins and can be used with a computer or  smartphone. When using a hardware wallet, you are in full control of  your digital assets, as they are not stored on a third-party server.  Additionally, hardware wallets have a wide variety of features and  features, such as multi-signature protection, that make them much more  secure than custodial wallets. Here are some good hardware wallets.....* Ledger Nano X ‚Äì Popular Hardware Wallet. ...* Trezor Model T ‚Äì Top-Notch Security. ...* Ledger Nano S Plus ‚Äì Good for those on a Budget. ...* SafePal S1 ‚Äì Secure and Cheap. ...* Ledger Stax ‚Äì New Awesome Ledger Wallet. ...* D'CENT ‚Äì Nice Design and Functionality.**Software Wallet:**  Software wallets, on the other hand, are digital wallets that store  cryptocurrency in the cloud or on a computer hard drive. Unlike hardware  wallets, these are hot wallets, meaning they are connected to the  internet and are much more vulnerable to external threats. However, the  main advantage of software wallets is that they are much easier to use  than hardware wallets, making them a popular choice for beginners. They  also come with a range of features, such as multi-signature  authentication, which can further increase the security of your assets.* Best Overall and Best for Security:  Guarda Wallet* Best for Beginners:  Exodus Wallet* Best for Bitcoin:  Electrum* Best for Mobile:  Mycelium* Best for Low Costs:  Coinbase WalletIn  conclusion, both hardware and software wallets have their own set of  advantages and disadvantages.. While hardware wallets are by far the  most secure option, they may be more difficult to understand and use.  Software wallets, on the other hand, may be more user-friendly, but they  are much more vulnerable to digital theft or hacking. Ultimately, the  choice should come down to your own individual needs and preferences.

We all know, as it sits right now, the value of crypto is an investment vehicle that we will later convert back to our respective government backed currencies. I think most of are holding out for mass adoption in the future but in all reality, as it stands, the value of our digital assets are only valuable if we can cash out. Governments around the world no doubt see the value and innovation of digital currency and block chain technology. They are trying or already have entered the space; giving them the ability to retain control and manipulating the money supply into a digital future. If the government can provide a product with similar technological benefits and the backing of said government, the draw to decentralized crypto takes a hit. Essentially we will be operating under the same systems we have, just cashless.In order for mass adoption to take place, there has to be a monumental shift of power in the monetary system from the world governments to the people. Which would require consensus from the general population. What vehicle gets us there?

Expiring money is good because it forces you to buy. With the logical consequence you are unable to save. Authors sure point to the fact that the expiration function should be only temporary and limited to exceptional circumstances. Too bad that history proves them wrong. As they say, there is nothing more permanent than a temporary government measure.Sure expiring money MAY be helpful in correcting or preventing certain monetary and economical issues. But would trade away your capacity to save for you, your family and your descendants in exchange of a form of control or relief in  circumstances such as recessions or depressions? Be careful before answering. History has proven over and over again how even the worse economical situation is temporary. It ain't called economic cycle for no reason. Expiration dates, on digital money, for which there is ample evidence their control will be centralized, is on the other hand very permanent. You will be trading away your capacity to provide yourself and your next of kin with any chance of bettering your condition. Forever. Because you will have to trust a third party not to abuse this function. This third party is the CBDC issuer AKA government and central banks. You know, in the same way you have to trust right now the same entities not to debase your national currency. And we all know how well all of that turned out to be.'But everyone will be subject to it! No way the rich will accept it!' I can already hear that. Rich and powerful people will have a way out in the same way they have a way out from not paying taxes right now. Don't know how? Let me tell you- legal exemptions: while you won't be able to save for the next 3 months because of the next pandemic (not making it up, they are mentioned in the article as a legit way to justify expiration), your politician will have most of his expenses registered as official and those will likely be subject to exemption from expiration and/or a lengthier one- playing the system: expiring money for everything and everyone will hinder economic growth and corporations need customers to function. Special provisions will be in place for any money held by companies, possibly big ones so to kill Small and Medium Enterprises, that will require longer or unlimited expiration so as to cover the costs of operations and be able to function properly. And while your local grocery store will close down because doesn't have enough revenue to pay its supplier because the money expired, megacorp will be able to conduct business as usual. And while you wonder how the hell could you manage to setup an LLC to shield your savings, a rich guy already set up offshore companies exchanging among them or immobilizing capital and enjoy a new form of saving. Which they already do by the way by setting up fake companies and hiding money as liability capital. And if you're thinking I'm being paranoid take a read at the articles. They specifically mention how convenient expiring money is 'to ban certain users from access to cash in a way similar to blacklisting'. But you shouldn't worry right, because you're doing nothing wrong or illegal.

Fed rate hikes, looming recession fears (or recession/depression/total economic collapse depending on your country) and inflation still running rampant in most countries. People are in fear of AI, and the unbelievable potential AI has to put many people out of a job, in the next 10-20 years. So while this is all going on my thought was, what could come out of all of this chaos, and fear, to make The People of any country actually want to adopt a CBDC?Well, a thought experiment I had was, that the Government will have a lot of trouble on their hands with their Crypto competition. Bitcoin is wonderful, as it is the hardest money on Earth. However, Bitcoin isn't necessarily the model or competition that the Government really sees as a real problem for CBDC trust and acceptance in my opinion. **The real problem for a CBDC is, Proof of Stake crypto currency. Below I will explain Proof of Stake, for anyone curious as to how it works as a rough concept (many different versions exists with their own trade-offs), so if you know how it works, feel free to skip too the next section.*****Basic premise of Proof of Stake***Proof of Stake, is where holders of cryptocurrency, can choose to lock up their tokens with validators. Those holders still retain rights of ownership to this tokens, however, their tends to be a lockup period or a certain number of days for the tokens to unbond from a validators pool of tokens. These Validators, are the block producers and provide the gate keeping to the network via by on-chain governance in the case of Cosmos and Algorand, or by social consensus, in the case of Ethereum. With these various systems in place, it is important to clarify that the system of incentivizing good behavior on the behalf of Validators is that if they remain honest, then part of the inflation of the specific chain is paid to the Validator. In the case of a validator doing something malicious or against social consensus, delegators can redelegate their stake away from a certain validator. Another penalty is in the case of double signing or failing to upgrade their software, a slashing and jailing penalty can be an effective way to remove some or all of the power away from the malicious validator and into validators who are proving to be trustworthy. ***Understanding how this model competes with a CBDC***Now that we know why proof of stake exists, and a rough concept on how it operates. I see that with Proof of Stake, the delegators, or rather The People of the world can have censorship resistant access to a decentralized Universal Basic Income, by delegating their tokens and earning income by means of staking to these validators. That system is by far, a naturally better system as opposed to a centrally controlled and and easily censorable form of digital money. That leaves only one option the Government really has, to compete with a more liberating form of a quasi-universal basic income. That is bribe the People who don't realize or care about the liberation that crypto can provide, through universal basic income via easy, automatic distributions on their CBDC. ***Conclusion***As AI becomes more prevalent and advanced, more jobs could be lost and people may be forced into needing some sort of UBI in my opinion. My preference is to utilize my ability to work and make money now, to enter into the quasi-UBI system that is Proof of Stake crypto currency. However, many people will be late, and the poorest of those people will be bribed into survival through the offering of a universal basic income and the convenience that a CBDC can offer. Stay vigilant for more Universal Basic Income talk. It may come around the time of a full CBDC release in a country near you. Government bribery taken to a whole new level.***Tldr; As Government distrust persists, and the AI narrative continues to grow. It is becoming apparent that AI could begin to cause large amounts of Job loss, and force Governments to provide a Universal Basic Income to citizens, as a new major source of income for the average Joe who can't find a job or meaningful income.******Proof of Stake as it stand, will somewhat act as a quasi-form of Universal Basic Income in the future, for those savvy enough to understand how to delegate on-chain and for those with enough money to utilize this as a viable income source. However, many people may choose to be left out of this alternative financial system, and opt-into a CBDC system. This would be, presumably if Universal Basic Income becomes the primary driver to such a system and a CBDC proves to be the more convenient option for the average citizen.***",False,"Proof of Stake, AI, CBDC's and the bribery of Governments using Universal Basic Income",u/[deleted],0,6,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12eaz06/proof_of_stake_ai_cbdcs_and_the_bribery_of/,[]

He basically said there were holes in the information supplied to them from Uphold and Binance, missing purchase price data. When the data is missing, they default your cost to zero. So when you sell something, for example, 5 bucks, it's 100% return on investment because they have it marked that you paid nothing.They had sent me the C2501 saying I made 168,000 in 2021 and that I'd have 30 days to tell them otherwise. That time passed, but the guy on the phone said I'm good, I just need to send in the corrections. He said in a few weeks I'll receive a CP2000 in the mail saying I owe like 40k in taxes, but that it isn't true and it will be rectified once I submit a Schedule D and an 8949.I plugged my accounts into Koinly like many advised. Don't hook up to the API for your exchanges, it's more accurate to import your tax reports that you download from the exchanges.Anyway, I'm feeling much better about this! Thanks!**---------original post**Okay, so let's say I bought a Bitcoin for $50,000, then I turned around and sold it for $49,000. The IRS is telling me that's $49,000 income for 2021. Or if I solid it for $50,002, that's $50,001 income. See, I see that as $2 income. (Completely hypothetical, I didn't buy bitcoin really).That's basically what's going on in a nutshell. Uphold, Robinhood, Binance, all reported to the IRS for me automatically (I remember I think it was Uphold that initially sent out bad tax records and had to 'apologize' to everyone and resubmit to the IRS). Not sure how much that has to do with it.Anyway, it looks like they are treating every single sale for USD as a taxable event. I was under the impression if it's on exchange and I'm just doing quick trades back and forth to switch/convert/trade for different cryptos that wouldn't happen.Am I completely screwed? Should I have been parking in tether this whole time to switch between crypto coins?It's so frustrating how complex this is and almost no tax accountants know anything about crypto to answer these questions.It's pretty much impossible to talk to the IRS it seems and of course it's still corrupt and won't tell you how much you owe.Not only that, I don't think they called me. I missed the mail they sent me with a deadline to tell them if I contest the amounts....I'm not running from the law or ignoring it or evading it, but I didn't file it on my return because I know I came out of my trades overall making less than I put in, so in my mind, that's no income, so it wouldn't be taxed.I may have made a horribly uneducated decision.Any advice is appreciated.",False,"Help, please help me understand the IRS.

And how many doors and points of weakness they have.Ease of use is already here:https://preview.redd.it/k5jnf9gb6bsa1.jpg?width=1034&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b8a146a01ae3c1858c82a251e96260e406b0a9d&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/h4s9m2qc6bsa1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d9543298fb63f7cb8a3e98437ba45e27744bc693&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/ib9ts1sd6bsa1.jpg?width=408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a3cc7a9287354e31a102a40bcc95df1e3c98e07a&#x200B;# No one is accepting it and you can't use it anywhere?While it's true that we still need a lot more brick and mortars to accept it directly, when you go online, you definitely have a lot more options. It's still a long way form 'no one is accepting it'.You'll still find some businesses that accept it, and places like Subway, Chipotle, local restaurants, local coffee shops, etc... all depending of course on your country and city.And it goes up drastically more, if you use things like Flexa, crypto cards, and services that lets you use the Visa network.While you have to use their network, and you aren't benefiting from the blockchain features as much, Visa does give you an off ramping option now. So it does open the door for more ways to unload and use your crypto.Personally, I don't like that service, I prefer using my crypto directly and benefit from the features of blockchain and its security. And you can buy anything from groceries to gold with direct crypto payment.&#x200B;# It has no use?Anything that uses blockchain, by definition gives you at least 5 utilities and 5 services. It gives you a security service, it provides a database, it gives you an authentication service by being able to verify transaction and authenticating the tokens, it provides global services that are borderless, and it gives you the benefits and services of decentralization.Crypto has additional utilities on top of that. It's an alternative currency not controlled by a government or country. It's also absolute transactions and absolute money, not some IOU or debt system. It also gives you absolute ownership of the money you have.And that's just the currency side. There's also a whole self banking and defi side to it. But that's getting too big for a post.And there's utility going beyond financial, like smart contracts, utility tokens, etc... But that's even bigger and would need a whole other post.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/8sypqzms6bsa1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71d7ed9b8053a907f38da24c6859fe5040092625# It's all a Ponzi/pyramid scheme?This is the easiest one to debunk.Basically, it's a simple case of just looking up the definition, and going on an chain explorer and see for yourself if there is a Ponzi going on:[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp)[https://www.blockchain.com/explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)&#x200B;In most cases, people didn't bother to look up the definition, or just don't know how crypto is traded. Much less that you can look up on chain for yourself to see that there isn't a Charles Ponzi involved.And typically, they think if you have to sell your coins to someone else at a higher price to be able to make a profit, then it's a scam. That just describes capitalism.When really, a Ponzi needs to payout some kind of yield or interest for the investment you bought, like every year for instance. And what makes it a Ponzi, is those yields don't come from any growth or money generated. They come from a Charles Ponzi taking the money from new investors, and using that to pay the yields of early investors.Selling your coins to someone on an exchange, at the price they decided they wanted to give you for your coins, is not a Ponzi. That's the same thing as someone on eBay deciding that they are willing to give you $100 for your Big Mac coin.There are definitely cryptos that are scams, but the scams are sually pump and dumps, or devs lying about what the coin does, rugpulls where they control most of the coins, or have a very centralized mechanism. It's not Ponzis, pyramid schemes, etc...It's just shitcoins and scams.HEX is the closest crypto I know to a Ponzi. But it's still not a true Ponzi.And it's pretty much the same story with the pyramid scheme. I'm not selling Bitcoins from exchanges to 4 people below me, who will cut me a commission when they sell it to other people.&#x200B;# There is no intrinsic value behind crypto?This has mostly been explained in the utility section already.When you sell software or a digital tech solution, where is the intrinsic value behind it? It would be the solutions it provides and its ability to solve a problem.After all, the whole point of tech is to solve a problem.Crypto solves the problems of incorporating decentralization and removing corruption and the need for trust in financial systems. Along with providing an alternative digital currency that has no government and no borders. Along with providing absolute transaction, absolute money, and absolute ownership, with no strings attached.Of course, that's just the tip of the iceberg, and what crypto provide at just its core. There's self banking, store of value, decentralized finance, smart contract, and a world of utility tokens, depending on the coin.And just like a security tech firm, a database company, a payment network, all are considered to have intrinsic value, so does cryptos with their blockchain, providing those same services, and adding decentralization to all that.&#x200B;# Crypto is too easy to hack, and gets hacked all the time?This misconception really comes from mainstream media.That's because whenever someone loses their coins, gave away their seed phrase to a phishing email, gives permission to a smart contract, leaves their seed phrase in the open on their computer, etc... the media labels it a crypto hack.Same when an exchange gets hacked and people lose their Bitcoins, they say 'Bitcoin got hacked'. It's not the crypto or the blockchain that got hacked, it's the exchange.To actually hack Bitcoin, you'd need to break the SHA-256 cryptography. So you would need a few million years.Alternatively, you could do a 51% attack. But that would be insanely expensive, because you need to outperform massive farms of computing power around the world. And you would only be able to change blocks for just a few minutes. Your work would be immediately undone and invalidated.You'd have to basically force a hard fork, but then who is gonna use your new coin?There have been coins like ETC that have had successful 51% attacks multiple times, but they're still doing fine today.Right now, the best point for a hack is on a bridge, as we've seen with Harmony. They can be more vulnerable. And maybe you'll be lucky, and a boneheaded team will leave a vulnerable password.But usually, if someone will hack crypto, they're not gonna spend thousands of years going after the blockchain, they'll just go after exchanges, and entities outside the blockchain.&#x200B;# It's used too much by criminals?If you compare it to traditional finance, the amount of criminal activity in crypto pales in comparison to the amount of criminal activity that used fiat and traditional finance.Yes, crypto is increasingly used by criminals. But anything that's seen as money and has value, might be used by criminals. Especially if it's an easy and efficient type of money that you can send anywhere across the world.But if something being used by criminals is an argument against crypto, it should first and foremost be an argument against fiat and traditional finance.HSBC has laundered billions of dollars for the Mexican drug cartel. An estimated $4 billion, making HSBC at least $800 Million in profit.... that we know of. That's just what they got caught with.And that's just one bank, and just their Mexican cartel related crimes.But yes, crypto will be used more and more by criminals, because it's just that easy to use, that efficient, and that simple to transfer anywhere, and they don't have to use a bank.So when people use the argument that crypto attracts criminal usage, they accidentally admit that crypto has some useful tech features that makes it easier to use.But to make an argument that crypto can't work because it's used by criminals, you'd first have to say that the banking world can't work.&#x200B;# Quantum computing will end crypto?While in a couple decades cryptos may have to build quantum resistance, it's not an issue now. But cryptos are already building quantum resistance right now.The ability for quantum computing to break a SHA-256 crypto in a under a century, is still a long ways away. And that kind of computing power would be threat to the banking world long before it's a threat to crypto. Also, the way qubits works great for some types of computations, but is not necessarily ideal to break cryptography.Also, as quantum computing develops ways to break cryptography, cryptography can also use that same power to make their security stronger.Either way, quantum computing is only a real concern for crypto, if someone in the future has a time machine.&#x200B;# Tether will end crypto, because it's the only thing causing the price to go up?There is this theory that Tether minting is what causes Bitcoin's price to rise.But all you have to do is look at the charts between futures, Tether minting, and Bitcoin's action to see that Tether looks more like it prints in response to supply and demand.There's also been a scientific study that actually debunked this. [https://decrypt.co/26399/tether-not-pumping-bitcoin-new-academic-study-claims](https://decrypt.co/26399/tether-not-pumping-bitcoin-new-academic-study-claims)And now that I've seen what happened when UST, a top 5 market cap stablecoin, collapsed in the middle of a bear market. I'm not as convinced as I was before that even if Tether collapsed it would end crypto. I was really shocked how quickly we bounced back from the Luna collapse. Especially during a bear market and so many macro economic bad news.It would definitely be devastating, but I don't think it would end crypto.&#x200B;# It's too easy to make a mistake?This one is the only anti-crypto argument that's really true on this whole list, but it's more of a case that it's only one half of the story, and that it cuts both ways.It's easy to make a mistake, but it's also just as easy to ensure you don't make a mistake.With more power comes more responsibilities. So the more you give yourself responsibility and self custody, the more you are responsible to check your mistakes.There are very easy methods to ensure you don't make a mistake. Like scanning a QR code. Checking the first and last few characters. Or the simplest and most effective is to send a test transaction.There's also smart contracts and cryptos like EOS with reversible transactions.But as it turns out, people don't find those services really worthwhile, since you can just check the transaction, or send a test transaction. So why bother with a smart contract. I think people still prefer the absolute transaction that doesn't come with any 'buts' or 'ifs'.Out of everything on the list, I think this is still the most legitimate concern.&#x200B;# It's too volatile to be able to use it?While it's true that sometimes it can have very volatile periods when it's not crabbing, that volatility hasn't stopped people and companies from using it.It has maybe slowed down the usage. Mainly because long term, people think it will go up more than go down, and are hanging on to it.I got to get a really good perspective on this when I was lucky enough to get paid in crypto.It has really opened my eyes to the myth that it's impossible to use it because of the volatility.That notion has been a little overblown.Yes, there are times where there is a lot of volatility, and I might pay extra pennies to a few dollars on my groceries. But the next volatility period, I might gain a few dollars.But overall, most of the time there's isn't that big of a price change to affect my grocery shopping. Plus I used mostly XLM. It's been tamed enough to shop with.What most people may not realize, is the price isn't set in the morning. The price is set at the time of the transaction. So you pay exactly the same price you would have paid with fiat, at that exact moment.It's more of an issue of how long you hold your crypto between the time you are paid and the time you shop. Not the purchase itself.So the purchase itself, isn't actually affected by volatility. It's the holding period.But yea, if you get paid in crypto during a bear market, you want to spend that more quickly. But during a bull market, you want to do it more slowly. That's really the main difference.&#x200B;# Regulation will kill crypto?Crypto is already regulated. Has been for many years.There's a misconception that crypto is some dark web money that operates entirely outside the law.But there are laws already in place defining the rules of use in each country.In the US for instance, it's regulated by the government, under various laws by different entities like the FTC, SEC, IRS, state legislation, etc..Of course, legislation for everything changes and gets adjusted all the time. So those legislation will likely change.&#x200B;This narrative really comes more from a fear of more regulation, and mainly US regulation.But crypto isn't exclusive to the US.And we've already seen crypto bans come and go in many countries before. Countries with much larger population than the US, like China and India.&#x200B;But crypto has a lot of allies now, and we're not in the days when pretty much all banks, and most politicians were really trying to kill crypto.Now there's politicians, banks, financial institutions, billionaires, major companies, etc... that have become pro-crypto or at least warmed up to it.Even the anti-crypto crowd has increasingly shifted from 'killing crypto' to 'Ok it's not all bad, but let's put restrictions to protect the public from scams'.There will probably be some bad or dumb legislation for crypto along the way. There's always some new dumb legislation for just about anything.But crypto isn't gonna get killed off by regulation any time soon. And the possibility for that has probably long gone.# # ",False,Countering all the major anti-crypto arguments in one post.,u/[deleted],2,77,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dut7r/countering_all_the_major_anticrypto_arguments_in/,[]

PayNow is akin to MasterCard or Visa and vendors can offer QR code for customers to scan. It's also free. Everyone can register for one with their phone number and send instant payments of up to 250K (and up to 1M for some banks). It's linked directly to your bank accounts and the PayNow network enables interbank transfers instantly, limitlessly.The FAST network is another network similar to the PayNow system, allowing even higher limits. None of the two systems has suffered any major breakdowns or reliability issues since their inception more than a decade ago. China also has their own version of this system, with instant settlement and near limitless transfers. Of course, owing to its restrictive capital flow, there are numerous AML restrictions in place that may block your transfers. Nonetheless, the system can allow near limitless transfers. Their payment networks have also been online for more than a decade. Now my question: is America's FedNow similar to these systems? And if so, why is America so backwards in implementing such systems when other countries implemented such systems almost a decade ago? More discussion points: for countries like China, Singapore where instant settlement has been available for nearly a decade and is free to use, what does p2p blockchains bring to the end user? Assuming the end user trusts their governments, the only benefit I can see is that there's no AML/restrictions in place. And yes, I understand that cryptocurrency is about owning fungible digital gold and I too lean on the libertarian spectrum, but there are countries in the world that has a higher level of trust from their citizens. In these countries, what does a public append only ledger bring to the table? And for developing nations, what's stopping them from simply importing Singapore's payment network? A public blockchain at its core is simply another implementation of such a system, just with a wider developer base and more standardised APIs for developers and end users to create better looking frontends. Finally, for better discussion, please avoid downvoting for disagreeing with me. Downvote only if you think it's irrelevant.

It follows an intensive investigation involving collaboration between security professionals, law enforcement, and community volunteers.*Euler says investigators were able to collect a significant amount of information and leads as early as within 24 hours of the attack, but it had to keep all sources of information confidential while the negotiations were ongoing.*As others have pointed out, the Euler recovery is a reminder to all would-be black hats that it is very difficult to remain anonymous online if there's a sufficiently skilled and motivated group of people looking for you.*The platform says that since the community investigation is now over and the stolen funds were given back as promised, the $1 million bounty it previously offered for information about the attacker will no longer be available.*Since the exploiter returned funds as promised, the $1 million rewards campaign will no longer be accepting information.*Euler says it is now focusing on claims and is set to present a proposal for restoring user funds in the coming days.*All energy has now turned to making sure affected users can claim back their share of the recovered assets as soon as possible.**The Euler community and affected users have already begun developing a plan for this, which Euler Labs will help contribute to.*[Via The Daily Hodl](https://dailyhodl.com/2023/04/06/200000000-in-stolen-crypto-recovered-by-defi-platform-after-community-led-investigation/)",False,"$200,000,000 in Stolen Crypto Recovered by DeFi Platform",u/[deleted],0,2,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dqveu/200000000_in_stolen_crypto_recovered_by_defi/,[]

Are we in a bubble right here or do we really have the chance to break through? I can see why people are so excited about crypto, it as the potential to be faster, more secure, and more accessible than traditional finance. And as someone who's seen firsthand how broken the traditional financial system can be (think of 2008 and 2023) I think that's really promising. Hopium is strong with me. As Agent Mulder would have put it: I WANT TO BELIEVE. There are still a lot of skeptics out there.

But I think as more and more people get involved, and as the technology evolves to be more user friendly, those barriers will start to break down.It's not just about investing either. I think crypto has the potential to fundamentally change the way we think about money and finance. We could see more decentralized systems that are more democratic and less reliant on big banks and financial institutions. And that could be a really good thing for a lot of people. Again: I WANT TO BELIEVE.I don't know what the future of crypto holds. It could fizzle out, or it could revolutionize the financial system as we know it.

Oasis is a sizeable portion of my portfolio. 2. This privacy talked about in this post isn't anonymity, this post has nothing to do with Monero.# What is Oasis at its core?Oasis Network is a layer-1 PoS blockchain platform designed to enable secure and private data sharing, DeFi, and AI applications. The network uses a modular architecture where it has an unlimited number of **paratimes** (you can look at these paratimes like DOTs parachains) which all answer to the consensus layer. This design allows for parallel execution, which significantly enhances the network's scalability and throughput. The network also incorporates advanced cryptographic techniques such as secure enclaves and ZKPs to protect user data and ensure privacy.Currently, there are 3 paratimes on mainnet;1. **Emerald:** just your normal EVM paratime, provides cheap transactions and whatnot.2. **Cipher:** A WebAssembly (WASM)-based paratime with privacy features. Meant for Rust devs.3. **Sapphire:** EVM paratime with privacy features. Meant for Solidity devs.# Oasis Privacy LayerSapphire is the most interesting out of these 3 paratimes as it now only allows for any solidity dev to build their dapp on Sapphire with privacy. It can also provide privacy to any dapp on any other EVM chain out there, this is called the Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL).This means that any dapp that wants to apply some form of privacy in their dapp can do so within a matter of minutes. So if someone wants to make a strategy game and implement fog of war, then this info can be private or if a DEX wants to obscure the amount of gas used in a transaction to get rid of those pesky MEV bots then one could do that. For more examples of privacy use cases in the crypto space, see my previous post: [The Future of Privacy in Crypto: Examples/Use Cases for ZK-Proofs and TEEs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12043b3/the_future_of_privacy_in_crypto_examplesuse_cases/)But what about the user, does applying OPL to your dapp hinder the user in having to accept yet another transaction and have spare ROSE in some wallet to pay for it all? No! That's the beauty of this system, it pays for this privacy layer using a relay function. This basically means that it automatically converts whatever token you are using to pay for the transaction in the first place to $ROSE. **This way the user won't even know it's been using OPL as privacy layer/sidechain in the first place.** So to be more precise OPL can provide privacy on **Ethereum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrium One, Arbitrium Nova, Fantom, Moonriver, Avalanche & Polygon**. # Why would Polygon need a privacy layer when it already has zkEVM?This is what I would be thinking if I were to read about Oasis the first time. The thing is ZKP is an amazing technology, but is limited in its application due to its complexity and thus also due to its performance. So for certain privacy aspects, a dev should use ZKPs but for most of them, Oasis's way (Trusted execution environments, TEEs) will be the preferred option. See more on the topic of ZKPs or TEEs here, although my writeups are probably a bit biased I still think it gives a fair overview of both technologies: * [How TEEs privacy features help enable businesses to transition from web2 to web3 in places ZKPs can not provide privacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12akup2/how_tees_privacy_features_help_enable_businesses/)* [Zero Knowledge Proofs vs Trusted Execution Environment; Different Technologies for on-chain privacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11hmu10/zero_knowledge_proofs_vs_trusted_execution/)# PumpamentalsI do want to provide a bit of extra information about certain partnerships and overall information about the project that would be considered a shill post in its own right. I hope to balance this out by also providing the FUD of this project later on. &#x200B;1. The founder of this protocol, Dr. Dawn Song is a very interesting person in her own right, although not really operating at the forefront of crypto she does have a lot of knowledge when talking about anything Privacy, cryptography & AI.  She's currently a computer science professor at UC Berkeley, who has contributed significantly to the field of security and privacy. With an H-index of 134, she's seen as one of the most important people in the field of computer science. Here she is on the Lex Fridman podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhY95m-WD'_E&ab'_channel=LexFridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhY95m-WD_E&ab_channel=LexFridman)  2. [Partnership with Instagram,Meta](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/collecting-and-measuring-demographic-information/): This is in my opinion still the first and only actual AI partnership in the crypto space. Meta uses Oasis's TEEs to make it possible for their models to use sensitive data which wouldn't normally be accessible to them. With the use of these TEEs Meta can use this data, process it and work with the results without exposing what this data is and where it came from.   3. Binance has been steadily buying up as much rose as it can over the past few years. I'm not sure if they do the same with other projects, but it does seem curious to me. Surely they have a plan.   A tracker following Binance's stake in ROSE can be seen here: [Big Binance Monitor.](http://gardentools.jamie-oconnell.com/gardenTools_monitor_bb.html) # So what is the FUD?I guess the FUD is the TEEs Oasis relies upon and in particular on SGX. As you can see here [https://sgx.fail/](https://sgx.fail/) SGX has a history of failing to whitehat attackers. The most recent example has been SCRT network (which also uses TEEs) was compromised due to them not implementing the necessary precautions for a known vulnerability. Oasis's Sapphire wasnt on mainnet at the time, but was aware of this vulnerability.  I do want to note that even though the attackers that run the website have attacked SGX, they still view TEEs in a positive light. One of the attackers cited Ekiden (an important TEE paper that Oasis is built upon) in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tom_yurek/status/1597660344876699648) on how it can work to mitigate it. Another way of mitigating it is to use ORAM which was brought up in a panel in ETH Denver 2023. Another FUD would be obscurity, Oasis Network, despite attending ETH Denver, and Smart Con (all three of them) are still largely unknown in the large crypto sphere and thus you could argue will have a harder time attracting developers to code dApps in their ecosystem.

I think most of us have a general idea of how the situation went. Circle's USDC had around $3.3 Billion in reserves locked in Silicon Valley Bank. This accounted for somewhere in the realm of 7-8% of their reserves that were(temporarily) lost, and the subsequent panic and chaos in markets as a result.On the down-low, Coinbase was making moves to backstop USDC's missing reserves, but the deal, after coming near being completed, was never closed due to the actions of the Fed, FDIC and the Treasury in backstopping banks and assuring customer deposits. Again, there's always a story behind the headlines.In Coinbase 2022 Q4 report, they disclosed that interest from USDC on their platform was a significant factor in their profits, and a continually growing one. How much of a factor? Well, interest income, that is comprised mainly of USDC earnings, as outlined several times in the financial report, was 326 million in 2022. Coinbase also reported that '*A hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in a $191.3 million increase in total revenue*'. This is to say, a 1% increase could have them earning 6.25% more profit on 3.2 Billion in total revenue. Not a small factor at all.Interest income is also comprised of interest derived from custodial funds and loans as well as USDC interest, the exact ratio of it is unknown however.

So let's start with ETH. ETH is the seemingly leader in creating the whole Web3 situation, nothing else comes close in TVL, dev staying power, dapps, and profit via fees. You wanna dex? You wanna bridge? You wanna stable coin? You wanna NFT? ETH has all of that and moreSo what about DOT? Well it has a different governance system, arguably better. Different shards than ETH perhaps better. It's built on a chain that makes interoperability much easier than ETH. Ok so why isn't DOT #1? That's because 1st mover benefit, name recognition, and tokenomics. On the shards you don't have to pay with DOT tokens so that doesn't increase price. And your DOT can be locked for up to 2 years if you choose to lend to particular shards (parachains) during auction. Oh and last I checked 10% inflation compared to ETHs Deflation.And ADA? First I'm going to simply say there's been a lot of drama in the ecosystem, too much to cover here but I don't love that. I found that ADA isn't different enough from ETH for me to feel it offers anything special. At least DOT had interesting governance, auctions, interoperability and sharding. ADA is different than ETH, it's a bit more secure in language, staking pools are also nodes, and it's one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies there is. But it also has a decent inflation rate low price demand and no real stable coins to help demand in tokenomics.So TLDR? I found that at least for me, I'd rather buy eth and layer2 protocols than DOT or ADA and I was disappointed that they were so similar to eth and poor supply and demand.Also ps this isn't perfect, I'm not especially intelligent, this is just my take away.",False,"My thoughts after studying ADA, DOT, ETH",u/[deleted],0,28,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dgwd6/my_thoughts_after_studying_ada_dot_eth/,[]

Most of the time, this is because everyone warns about 'impermanent loss' and investors become reluctant to take the risk.In this post, I want to clarify what IP is and when does it occur in simple terms.First of all: impermanent loss is **not actual loss, but less gain** compared to holding the two assets separately.This happens when one of the assets from the liquidity pool moves significantly compared to the price of the other.I think examples always paint the picture much clearly, so here is one:# Example: Providing Liquidity in a USDC/ETH PoolYou provide liquidity in a USDC/ETH pool. Let's say you provided $500 worth of each. So your distribution is $500 of USDC / $500 of ETH.Let's say ETH does a 2x during the year. That means that:**If you held them separately**: you would have $1000 worth of ETH and $500 worth of USDC. So **$1500 in total**.**If you held them in a pool**: As the price of ETH moves up, the pool will rebalance your position to 50/50. So you'll still make gains of ETH's rise, but a part of the ETH will be continuously redistributed to USDC to balance out the pool.This means that you'll end up with slightly less ETH and slightly more USDC at the end. So you will lose some of the upside *from the portion that will get redistributed to USDC*.Using the impermanent loss calculator ([https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/)), you would end up with **$1414 in total**.So still up from your initial investment of $1000, but lower compared to not providing liquidity ($1500).**However**, there is also the yield. If this pool yields for example 10% APY, you'll make around $100 in interest. This covers your 'impermanent loss'. Of course, this all depends on the APY and how the assets will perform.The important thing to notice is how small this so-called 'loss' is. So, if an asset doubles, you're only 5% better by holding the two separately. This means that impermanent loss can be devastating only in situations where assets move *significantly* from each other.Use the calculator above to see what it means by providing the initial prices and the future prices.Hope that this post was informative! Love you all and happy accumulating!**TLDR #2:*** $500 of USDC and $500 of ETH held separately, ETH does 2x, you have $1500.* $500 of USDC and $500 of ETH in a liquidity pool, ETH does 2x, you have $1414 + the APY you earned.Impermanent loss doesn't mean you're losing money, but that you're making less gains compared to holding the two assets separately.",False,Impermanent Loss - Simple Explanation (Liquidity Providing),u/[deleted],1,44,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dducc/impermanent_loss_simple_explanation_liquidity/,[]

Did you know that Germany operates one of the world's largest networks of Ethereum validators and accounts for nearly 6% of Europe's blockchain funding? Well now you know. But here's the kicker: Germany is second place and has a 22.8% share of all Ethereum nodes, while (unsurprisingly) the United States leads with a whopping 45.3%. That means both countries operate way more than half of the entire Ethereum ecosystem...So why is this happening? Well, some potential reasons could be the presence of a strong tech industry and infrastructure in both countries, favorable regulations and government support for blockchain technology, and a high level of interest and investment in blockchain technology among businesses and individuals. Berlin is considered a hub for blockchain innovation and the US is on the forefront of many modern technologies anyways. What I wonder, however, is how much of it is caused by cloud services and staking providers? A lot of nodes run on cloud services so this could play a big role I guess.But either way, I think there might be a few downsides and risks to this: for example it does reduce decentralization and make the network more vulnerable to censorship or control by those countries and/or cloud operators. It could also create single points of failure if something were to happen to the infrastructure or regulatory environment in one of those countries. Also it could reduce the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the Ethereum community, when a few players have a lot of voting power (staking pools).TL;DR: I found out Germany and the US operate more than half of the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

Retail clients trading in crypto derivatives are afforded important rights and consumer protections under financial services laws in Australia, including access to external dispute resolution through the Australian Financial Complaints Authority.Our targeted review of these matters is ongoing, including focus on the extent of consumer harms, said Mr Longo.## CryptoASIC has repeatedly warned potential crypto users that crypto is risky and complex. Crypto derivatives pose additional risks to consumers through the operation of leverage.Many crypto products and services are not regulated by ASIC. More than with other types of investments, crypto users should be prepared to lose any funds they invest in crypto.As we have said before, ASIC supports a regulatory framework for crypto with a focus on consumer protection and market integrity.

(weather it's CBDC's or crypto banks are pretty much done) The fiat standard world wide is over a century old, incase of the British Pound it's even older (300 years). this system moving ahead needs an overhaul and CBDCs' are it, first major upgrade to money in centuries.I understand we are all worried about the drawbacks of programmable money, but if you trust your governments (hahaha) then this is a tool they need. the Public expenditures in India and the US are in the billions with very little oversight and often take months to settle issues, scams and Audits, the amount of money scammed off the Exchequer by vendors and contractors is enormous and CBDC's can mitigate that in one shot, easier said than done but it can happen. the trillions spent on the Afgan war could have been very different if it were CBDC's with the possibility of reversing certain transactions.

Stellar Lumens was a promising project, and during that time, the price was a fraction of 0.02 per XLM. Somehow, I was lucky to have caught the wave, but I was not equipped with the right experience and knowledge.I did what I could- and came into this subreddit back then to chat around, understand the sentiments, and try to make the best of decisions.There were a lot of things happening during that time. there was this 'Flippening', where BCH was expected to 'flip' BTC. Some people believed it, some people didn't. The argument made sense at that point.Then, there was the ICOs. Every nook and corner had a new ICO, and everyone's trying to chase the next big thing. Here's the scary thing, everything became a big thing.Everyone's a genius in the bull market, and I was too a victim of being overconfident, and was clouded by my own greed. In my experience, XLM went from 0.02 to 0.63 in mere 2-3 months. I felt like I was the genius for 'Catching it early'. What I didn't realize was that all of these alt projects are similar to start-ups, and start-ups dies, eventually. XLM became what it is today, still rather reliable, but the promise it had back then was different from what it is now.The bear market was brutal. Similar to what we had seen recently, portfolios were wiped out by about 90% or so for those who are heavy on alts. Even if you have BTC and ETH, it'll take a dent. My unrealized loses made me chuck away my Ledger, and I didn't check it for 3 years.In the TradFi world, start-ups would see some diminishing in value after the timeline of 4-5 years. In DeFi, it is much faster. By the time the bear market occurred, most of us were still clinging to the faith of your own 'homework' because you thought you've done the genius thing once, and you'll do it again.Chances are- you won't.Projects started to get renamed. Some coins were deemed worthless. Top coins started falling off the cliff, and I went in silence for a good 3 years for believing that 'Holding is good'.What I've learnt was;1. Always rebalance your portfolio from alts to the core coins (BTC, ETH) after you have gained your unrealized profit.2. Always have an exit strategy and commit to it.&#x200B;I am sure most of the folks from the same timeline experienced similar things. I know a few people who were active in this subreddit back then, are not active now, despite the run that we had in 2020/2021.

Few weeks ago, the federal reserve has created around $400 billion out of thin air to stabilize the collapsing banking sector.

What prevents the US government from striking against bitcoin and purchasing every possible coin it can lay it hands on?It could easily suppress the price by enacting a ban on bitcoin and further squizzing banks cooperating with bitcoin, than purchase it at a steep discount all at once. Than, it probably could burn it and adjust its books as nothing ever happened.To those naive enough to think that the US government wouldn't do anything like this, I would like to remind you prohibition, war on drugs, crackdown on online poker, P2P file sharing, the silkroad, and backpage.com. Not to mention the different wars and clandestine CIA operations. Bitcoin threatens US financial hegemony, especially if it's value reach $300,000 per coin which projected in the next 3 to 5 years. Then, bitcoin value will be higher than the federal reserve balance sheet and the US government wouldn't be able buy it.Banning bitcoin in the US might hurt it, but wouldn't be fatal as it can pop up elsewhere.

I anticipate we will see a Bull eoy 2024 if not 2025, exceeding our most recent peaks.To give you a rundown on why I've made this choice today, I need to give you some history on how I came to be involved. Kicks off in 2016 when first hearing about nicehash and making money off your computer through some college friends. I wasn't able to make near enough on my shitty laptop, so called it quits rather quickly. I never stopped listening to crypto news though. Fast forward to 2017-2018 when I was convinced LTC was going to the moon and  had invested thousands at around $30-$50 each. I started hearing about not your keys not your coins, with everything in LTC though I made a paper wallet and called it a dayAs you can imagine, that went horribly for someone constantly moving each semester across state lines and dorms. It was lost in a pile of old documents that were thrown out to make room for the new year. I lost everything I had saved up over the years, and had to watch as LTC went on to continually break all time highs to nearly $400 in 2018 $50,000-$75,000 in net profits is a lot for a college student to have misplaced.My anger at what happened caused me to step back from the markets, even disregarding btc as it started breaking past $10k resistance in 2020. (Was a crypto turned spy options trader then).Following the FTX crash last summer, I realized I might once again have a chance to learn from my past mistakes and try again in this market. I disregarded everything for more $$ to invest in crypto, especially as it was falling under $20,000 for the first time. Seeing it bounce all the way back to $29k after my lowest DCA in the $15,000s I've realized much of my stress and anxiety recently has been on so much money sitting out there in the blockchainThere is more to life than just crypto, and safety is one of them for me. 1/4th of my crypto was sold today in order to set myself on a strong path for retirement in tax advantaged accounts. Something that may sound boring, but provides security that I've been missing this past year. Moral of the story is to never stop assessing your personal financial position or goals. Be honest with yourself and never let greed play a factor into your decision making (looking at you 10k ETH, 100k BTC.)For anyone that might be in a similar position, I would recommend the following books:The simple path to wealth by J.l. CollinsThe psychology of money by Morgan HouselA random walk down wall street by Burton MalkielAll three books weave amazing stories filled with facts on how to succeed not just in finance, but life as well.

Its primary function is to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions, which distinguishes it from traditional securities like stocks or bonds.Decentralization: XRP is powered by a decentralized blockchain network, meaning that no single entity has control over the system. Ripple, the company, is just one of the many participants in the XRP Ledger. This decentralization is in contrast to securities, which are usually tied to a specific company and its performance.Lack of ownership rights: Holding XRP does not grant the owner any rights to dividends, profit sharing, or voting rights in Ripple, the company. This characteristic sets XRP apart from traditional securities, which often provide these rights to their holders.No promise of returns: When purchasing XRP, investors are not promised any returns or profits based on the efforts of Ripple or other third parties.

Having 1 BTC is a goal we kept hearing for the whole bear market and we even had some people celebrating their success. Now some may say why is this so special, lets have a look at the statistical achievements if you own 1 BTC.Firstly, the total Bitcoin supply is 21 million, of course some of it is lost forever but those estimates range from 1 million coins lost to 6 millions coins lost, so we will not put that into our calculations. But remember that through this our numbers will be a lot more generous than in reality:# The Numbers for 1 BTC:Lets imagine one person can only hold 1 BTC at most that would mean by holding 1 BTC yourself, you are in a 0.26% minority.Calculations: 21.000.000 / 8 billion (human population) = 0.0026 '* 100 = 0.26%But obviously one person does not own only 1 BTC but many whales have thousands of them. To calculate now is nearly impossible so we will use estimates and guesses. We know that we are just about to have 1 million addresses with 1 BTC after over 10 years, now we will double that number for the future.Calculation: 2.000.000 / 8 billion = 0.025%Meaning you will be one in every 2 million person if you own 1 BTC.Now the current numbers: With 1 million addresses (not people) holding 1 BTC you are in at least a 0.01%. minority if you hold 1 BTC but likely it is way more.&#x200B;&#x200B;Hope you guys enjoyed looking through those numbers and realising that owning just 1 BTC would put you in a exceptional minority of the whole humanity.

With so many platforms falling short, it is important to highlight the best DeFi platforms out there in 2023. I would considered best for staking rewards or yield farming.1 - My personal CeFi pick will be **Nexo**. I used it for staking DOT, MATIC and ADA for a while and never had an issue with them also survived the 2022 debacle.2 - My second pick would be **Uniswap**. For those who never heard of Uniswap has been a staple in the DeFi world for years, and it's still going strong. The platform's DEX allows users to trade a wide variety of tokens.3 - I've also used **AAVE**, a DeFI lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend various cryptos for Yield Farming providing liquidity.What do you think about DeFi in general? Have you had good experiences with certain platforms? Share your best picks for 2023. Any good alternative to Nexo?Thank you!EDITIt seems the winners are: Uniswap, AAVE, SushiSwap and Osmosis.I've added NEXO as was the last survivor from last year debacle.

Major players like Saudi Arabia have also mentioned interest in such activities. Not to necessarily downplay the reports but as of now there have been no concrete moves that absolutely seal the deal on any of these reports.I want to make two things clear:1. The USD isn't going to disappear anywhere anytime soon at all. Given a choice, most firms and countries would obviously prefer the USD, compared to a more shady China or Russia. Far from being forced, most ever nation/international company in the world has elected to the the USD for themselves.2. There is an overreaction that the USD is going to disappear. It is sort of an understandable argument, especially for Americans, but it is unfounded to a fair degree and a less powerful dollar will actually help crypto as well as a lot of people worldwide.I have to first give background and try to explain how terrible a lack of forex, mainly USD but other major currencies as well devastates developing nations. The hint is basically in the name. developing nations have weak undeveloped/weak economies, such that they are unable to manufacture their own products and thus relies on imports to survive. However, almost all of these imports are prices in USD. This means that these economies are constantly struggling to gain USD to be able to purchase necessities for mere survival, and it comes at the cost of destroying their own local currencies. Hence, the collapse of Sri Lanka and the deep troubles of Pakistan.We then come to crypto. Most crypto pairs(spot) and contracts(futures) are quoted or settled in USD, such that for all the benefits that crypto is supposed to bring to the developing world, it is heavily held  back because the developing world is always a some sort of deficit in the store or supply of USD. Basically, you need USD to invest but there's never enough USD to go around and whatever USD there is simply goes to buying necessities to survive, not to push into a crypto product that could lose them 7% in a day on the little they already have. And then there more downstream effects like more hording of USD, more corruption and greed, less public trust, brain drain and it goes on.A world less dependent on the USD to settle trade then means there are more US dollars to go around and it eases the lives of those in the developing world to purchases necessities and may open the avenue for more to invest in crypto as well. The point is that less USD settlement dominance means more USD for everyone else which means more funds available to flow into crypto. Hence more adoption. In addition, a less valuable dollar means crypto pairs go up in value by default. And in an ironically way, a less powerful dollar also helps Americans because then the Fed and government have less of an excuse to print so much as well as there's simply less demand of nations fighting to buy up their printed dollars. So the US inflation problem is also alleviated, at least to a degree, as we know their insane printing a these levels would one day absolutely kill the dollar no question.Thus, it's not nearly as bad as some make it out to be.",False,The USD is going anywhere at all but a less strong dollar is better for crypto,u/[deleted],0,2,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12cm5xi/the_usd_is_going_anywhere_at_all_but_a_less/,[]

If the value of moons increases, reporting them now as income will result in long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. *Disclaimer: The information provided pertains to the United States.

First tip. Try it. Go to 'send' on your exchange and try to send to someone you know, or open up a different account on an exchange or wallet and try it. This is why crypto has so much potential. Digital transfer of wealth that has no boundaries. 2. When sending coins and tokens to other wallets/exchanges/friends. Always do a test transfer. Account for gas fees as losses. But always remember that from exchange to wallet (for example, Coinbase to Ledger/Exodus) will be expensive, but the other way around, not expensive because exchanges always take more.3. When sending coins/tokens, always double check the first few digits and last few digits before sending if you are not scanning the blockchain address. E.g. 0x341....345. Keyloggers that infiltrate your software may change these. I always use a VPN when doing this stuff online. In the US, we must have rights to VPN use. So important for security and privacy. Fight the RESTRICT act. 4. Double check if you need a memo or ID if you send/receive. Especially when sending back to an exchange. If you forget, contact your exchange. They can retrieve it for you always. Some for a cost, others no.  5. If keeping coins on your cold storage like a Ledger/Trezor etc.) keep an eye out for Token/Coin migrations. This is when certain projects change blockchains. You will have plenty of time to move your coins back on the exchange for an easy migration. This is rare but can happen. 6. Prepare a system of keeping seed phrases for different wallets. I keep mine in a certain photo album for example. If my Mom's writing 35 years ago is still legible on a certain paper in her photo albums, then mine will be as well. I find the metal writing stuff excessive, but you do you. Never keep it digital. Write it down clearly (my handwriting is horrible, but I really focus for this). 7. If someone sends you stuff = scam (here on Reddit as well). If something is too good to be true = scam. Stop and never buy/sell do anything crypto related if drinking (guilty of this a few times).8. Remember the lingo (jargon) for exchanges is always different. 9. If you are very active, slow down in the important moments like the transfer of coins etc.  Remember. That once you have your coins safely in cold storage (using a device to access your stash on the blockchain, e.g. Ledger, Trezor and others) these coins are yours. I have such a nice feeling knowing these are mine and secure. No bank has this. It is mine.
