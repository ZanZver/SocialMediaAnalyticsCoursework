There are a lot of people who really struggle to understand computers and I believe augmented reality will make it much easier for them to interact with computers as a whole through spatial computing. This underlying utility may pave the way for a virtual world ecosystem in which people may be able to get the same level of the sense of presence that they get in physical life in a digital space. # The transition to digital civilization It's my belief that when we are able to get the same sense of presence in a virtual space as in a physical space, we will stop building physical spaces. # The potential for crisis Every virtual world creator has the right to manage their own virtual world as they wish. However, if a virtual world becomes essential for human life, that creator may create large-scale censorship for a large part of the human population. Social media giants already ban their members on a regular basis without even stating the reason. For most, these platforms are not essential for life or income but one day virtual worlds may become the reality most call home. * What if one day what we say could get us banned from what most people consider reality? # The context for my questionI'd like to come up with a charter of rights and freedoms for the Metaverse and I would love your input. The key problem at hand is how we balance the rights of a virtual world creator to the rights of those who inhabit virtual worlds. There's an inherent tension between protecting the rights that a creator has over the world that they create versus the rights of individual users. ## Progress so far**Right to obscurity*** The right not to be individually penalized for non-criminal acts done outside of a particular virtual world.**Right to migration*** The right to switch from virtual world to virtual world without contractual hindrance.**Right of privacy**1. The right not to be tracked in a persistent, identifiable fashion, without expressed, written, and updated consent.2. The right to separately agree to the tracking of political or religious beliefs.3. The right to take down, or disassociate from, content published by oneself.## Breaking down the progress**Right to obscurity**Obscurity is all about making sure a global reputation system for the Metaverse is never created. I believe a global reputation system that's interoperable between worlds has the ability to create global censorship and therefore each virtual world should judge its members by their behavior within that world. If not, a single mistake, in the limited interpretation of what a mistake could be by one world, may cause us problems for the rest of our life. **Right to migration**As long as we can use viable alternatives to a virtual world, we are never locked out of the Metaverse as a whole. The big problem here is that the network effect may make those alternatives unviable just as competing with YouTube is almost totally unviable because of Youtube's massive viewer base. **Right of privacy**This is all about that extra layer of protection so that you can't be identified as belonging to a particular community as that identification process is the first step to maltreatment. # Ok, my question for real this time**How do we ensure that individual rights are fully protected even as we transition from the physical to the digital?**How do we avoid the network effect, (people wanting to be where the other people are) along with the enormous complexity of virtual worlds laying the foundation for a new reality that resembles the lack of rights and freedoms we see from today's social media giants? Let's say that we create a right to interoperability, such a right creates a financial obligation on the creator of a virtual world, something which will stifle innovation potentially. Moreover, interoperability isn't practical on so many levels when it comes to complex technology. Migration, sure but if one virtual world has the people it's not like those people can just walk into another virtual world -- keep in mind that virtual world creators size all of their doors to all of the items that you could wear in a potential virtual world.

For some applications, these properties can prove very valuable. Here they are spelled out:* Protocol adherence: The guarantee that a software system is following a given protocol.* Censorship resistance: The guarantee that users can properly interact with a software system.* Persistence: The guarantee that a software system will continue running far into the future.Those main seem intriguing, but what contributes to a digital substrates ability to guarantee them? The contributions mainly comes from two characteristics:1. Trustlessness: The minimization of trust required from the human operators of a digital substrate for a given PCP property to be upheld.2. Resiliency: The maximization of resiliency of a digital substrate to defend a given PCP property against attack from a third party.With those terms out of the way, we can dig into an analysis of the two main digital substrates for running software: servers, and blockchains. Let's take a look at each of them in turn to better understand how they compare in their PCP guarantees.## ServersAt a high level, a server is a single computer running software that people can interact with over the internet. Servers are what the internet is built on today. That being said, they don't offer the strongest PCP guarantees:1. Trustlessness: it's necessary to trust that the operator of a server will uphold protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence. At any moment the operator of a server could modify its behavior to breach its protocol, censor certain users, or terminate.2. Resiliency: a software deployment is only as resilient as the operator of the server. At any moment they could get coerced by a third party into modifying the server's behavior to breach the protocol, censor certain users, or terminate. Alternatively, it only takes a single hack to take control of the server, and a single explosive to destroy it.Now that we've seen what servers are capable of, let's see how blockchains compare.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/nb3c6csu4kpa1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=10b8694cbe0b926a4b34d8dfe1b034074a03a237## BlockchainsAt a high level, a blockchain is a network of servers that redundantly execute the same software and reach consensus on its status through a system of checks and balances. Part of its power lies in its inclusivity - anyone can contribute to the network by running a node without needing to ask anyone for permission. The idea of blockchain is to be *the* digital substrate which *best maximizes* PCP guarantees:1. Trustlessness: Let's break down this analysis into each of protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence.   1. Protocol adherence: every user has the ability to verify whether or not a blockchain is following a given protocol, so there's no need to trust the operators of the blockchain to uphold protocol adherence.   2. Censorship resistance: as long as at least a few percent of the servers which make up a blockchain don't try to censor a given transaction, it will not be censored. Coupling this with the fact that anyone can contribute to the operation of a blockchain by permissionlessly running a node, we find that blockchains are highly censorship resistant without needing to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold censorship resistance.   3. Persistence: anybody can contribute to the operation of a blockchain, so there's no need to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold persistence.2. Resiliency: following from the trustlessness properties, there is no centralized point of failure that a third party can coerce, hack, or destroy to induce a blockchain to break from protocol adherence, censorship resistance, or persistence. Instead, the third party will need to coerce the users themselves to not interact with a given blockchain. This is much more difficult. # So What? When Does It Make Sense To Use a Blockchain?Deciding between running software on a server or a blockchain comes down to a cost benefit analysis. The main advantage of using blockchain is its PCP guarantees, while its limitations include slower performance and weaker privacy capabilities (although these limitations are being eroded over time). In which applications are PCP guarantees actually valuable?For many applications, using a server is the better option. PCP guarantees are mainly important in cases where a significant conflict of interest appears between the operators of software and its users (trustlessness solves this), or when there are concerns of a third party interfering with software (resiliency solves this).Today, conflicts of interests are typically solved via government regulation. In fintech apps for example, rather than trusting software operators to uphold PCP, you rely on a government to ensure that the software operators adequately follow PCP.As far as concerns of a third party interfering with software goes, today, applications solve this by relying on a government to defend servers and punish those who try to interfere.So what's left? What types of applications does it make sense to deploy on a blockchain? We'll answer this question in a future post.

I'm kind of arriving on a realization that there's so much potential in the already-deployed, but over an unnecessarily diffuse landscape. a good demonstration of this to me has been the plethora of different talks from ETHDenver. more specifically, just look at all of the discussion and deployment around EIP-4337. tbh, there may be more of an opportunity to debate the finer details like the bundlers and the authentication methods than there is to eliminate the massive ecosystem cost of phishing links and lost seedphrases.there's also very fundamental communities in Ethereum, like gitcoin and scaffoldeth, where the public good can be consumed at scale but the core maintenance and composition of those is not proportionate (though arguably substantial). I'm not really discussing a problem, it's more of an subnominal opportunity. likewise, I'm not saying people aren't aware, it's more of a dilemma where the attention spans aren't overlapping on whatever public space we cover, and we're spending excessive capital 'treating the symptoms instead of curing the disease'.there's also the unspoken capture of zero-sum capital by inefficent mechanisms. for example, if every project  airdrop'd tokens/allowlists/access to recipients on the basis that they wholesale 'like/retweet/tag/comment', the outcome of that spent social capital is a network that echoes to itself. same for a lot of DAOs (plutocratic ones especially), if there's a sociopolitical whip to attend the same meetings, ratify the same proposals, agree on the same adversarial rules, burn the same gas, gaslight in the same manner, then we're spending extra on bargaining costs with less compatible communities, and getting more capitalized to become a monoculture. and we're losing the small fish along the way.there's parts of ethereum that do really well in these environments. MEV is actually working out really well when you look at it as a compositional problem. DeFi protocols innovate the classes of operation, liquidity, and hypothecation. node operators innovate on the other side, and in between there are a bunch of grayhats arbing the difference and forcing adaptation. crypto social media is really entertaining, there are maximalists and NFTers and other tings. there are new social protocols that run on their own rollup, or a sidechain, or even another network altogether. entire EVM sidechains & rollups are manifesting with modularity, DeFi consensus, you name it. airdrops & farmers continue to provide us a case study of sybil resistance in practice.but I still get this feeling that its too diffuse, and we've reached this stage where the aggregate sociocultural downside is growing faster than we're optimizing & accelerating critical, introspective development. personally, I'm totally fine with how the protocol is developing & scaling, and the applications on top are fun, if nothing else. the succinct cryptography is fascinating and the privacy innovations are inspring. however, there's too much opportunity & stakes on the table to ignore.this is what I'm proposing: there needs to be a stack of the 'fat protocol' vibe and 'social architecture' without any contrived, pyramid-scheme, ponzinomic, or walled-garden nonsense. git is crazy scalable software because it is so undefined. ethereum already has crazy scalable n-tiered architecture (like Default, Pipeline, and Diamonds). hypercertificates are already crazy scalable forms of fungible, verifiable credentials. I think there's a supercritical, supermodular application that inherits the social tech from teams like Lens, Orbis, Farcaster, the compositional tech from Scaffold, Gnosis, Gelato, Uniswap, Wagmi, & OS tools like Alpaca, Langchain, Forge, Arweave, ethOS, and others. there should be an OS-agnostic, token-agnostic open forum & groupchat platform with extendable, modular abilities like signing multisig transactions, deploying AMOs on other chains, deploying software, funding public goods, etc.in other words, I'm just saying (and experimenting) that the focus should be centralized on the core thesis: ethereum can be an internet-tier technology tree at a time when the world needs such a technology tree. it's kind of a farce whenever there's a random DAO committing death-by-committee/death-by-slushfund, whenever there's a seedphrase watering-hole scam on Twitter/Discord, or just the broader 'monkey jpeg'/ '$$$ hack'/'VC dump to community' image the public consumes. so let's just focus on the supercritical root application of that tech tree.",False,Centralization Possibilities,,0,4,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11yvmac/centralization_possibilities/,[]

And with Ethereum being the most popular blockchain platforms, we can expect a versatile and robust infrastructure for building smart contracts.After looking into some of the major industries in the crypto space, here are 4 common use cases I've come across in regards to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: the use of smart contracts here help facilitate transactions like lending, trading and borrowing which in turn helps in democratizing finance, making it more accessible to all, and reducing the need for middle men.For example, Uniswap is one such DeFi platform that uses smart contracts to exchange tokens without the need a centralized matching engine.* **Supply Chain Management**:  smart contracts help to automate supply chain processes in a number of different ways- from verifying product authenticity to managing inventory and payments which in turn leads to increasing transparency, real-time data, reducing costs, and preventing fraud.For example, Morpheus Network automates the flow of information and goods between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and end customers through smart contracts executed on the Ethereum blockchain.* **Real Estate**: smart contracts enable tokenization of real estate, fractional ownership and help with streamlining transactions. This can help increase liquidity, reduce costs, and also make it easier for all to access real estate investments.For example, Propy uses smart contracts in order to automate and secure the various stages of a real estate transaction which also acts as a digital escrow service.* **Gaming**: Smart contracts enable true ownership of in-game assets, create decentralized gameplays, and facilitate peer-to-peer gaming experiences.For example, Decentraland makes use of smart contracts which allows gamers to buy and sell virtual real estate and in-game assets in a transparent and secure way.I also came across the use of smart contracts in **identity verification**, but a **couple of questions** I have in relation to this are along the lines of how can cases wherein we see discrepancies in the information provided by users are handled? And also whether smart contracts can be audited to ensure its accuracy and efficiency?   It would be great if someone could help me understand this better.Have you come across some other common use case for smart contacts on the Ethereum blockchain? Would love to hear more about that.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

They are extensions of Ethereum where people can perform transactions while paying less fees. Here's a useful way to imagine this: Ethereum is a road with tollbooths, and the traffic can be very slow. The more traffic there is, the more expensive each toll is. Layer 2's are super-highways that are in parallel to the main road, allowing anyone to move back and forth between them.Just like a car can either be on the main road or the super-highway, if a wallet has a balance on Ethereum, it can move that balance to instead be held on a Layer 2. From there, that ETH can be spent on NFTs or used in DeFi platforms, or eventually moved back to Layer 1. The fees on Layer 2's are much cheaper than on Ethereum, so interacting with applications there can be much more cost-effective.Layer 2's generally only exist on Ethereum. Ethereum is one of the most expensive blockchains to transact on, having strived towards being secure and decentralized ahead of being cheap to use. Layer 2's make it cheaper to transact in a broader Ethereum ecosystem, while alternate Layer 1's exist that compete with Ethereum instead. These will often be immediately cheap to use due to either low traffic or greater centralization, so no Layer 2's exist for other blockchains yet.'*&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/b4sn0akq8boa1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=819d4bfccb19fc2ebe11368b7153315713f0d262&#x200B;# Sidechains vs RollupsThere are two main types of Layer 2, sidechains and rollups, and the differences between them are important to understand.A sidechain is an entire blockchain that runs in parallel to Ethereum and reports its status to the Layer 1. While connected to Ethereum through these status reports, sidechains are still separate blockchains. This means having a separate consensus model and set of validators. Sidechains require more than half of validators to agree on every block, and there are often very few validators to keep the network quick.Rollups, on the other hand, are not blockchains. They are off-chain networks where people can perform transactions, and those transactions are bundled together (or rolled up) and posted to Ethereum as one. Rollups use sequencers to bundle transactions together, which are still centralized technologies (although some are working to create decentralized sequencers).&#x200B;# Optimistic and Zero Knowledge RollupsRollups are a type of Layer 2 that bundles transactions and posts them together to Ethereum. There are two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge, also with important differences.Optimistic rollups don't need validators, but instead make available the data they sequence to be verified and challenged by anyone, for a certain period of time. If anyone discovers a dishonest transaction during that time, they can immediately prove its dishonesty using cryptography. As a result, only one honest verifier is required to keep optimistic rollups secure (as in, every other verifier could be dishonest and it wouldn't matter).Zero Knowledge rollups, on the other hand, don't need validators nor verifiers, instead using cryptography to prove the validity of every batch of transactions as it happens. Since every batch has an automatic proof of its own validity, no additional consensus or verification on transactions is necessary. While this is more secure, it is also more data intensive.&#x200B;[Source: msfew.eth](https://preview.redd.it/gku36rog9boa1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b587169887b9ccddb0ee4194f2674e1f95158c61)Currently, only optimistic rollups can be EVM-equivalent.'* Zero knowledge rollups can't perform the same complex transactions, since complexity makes generating those proofs more difficult. As a result, optimistic rollups seem to be better for elaborate applications, whereas zero knowledge rollups can be better for processing many simple transactions.'*The challenges towards creating EVM-equivalent zero knowledge rollups are significant, but there are companies working on these challenges and this could change in the future.&#x200B;# Why We Need RollupsRollups make fewer compromises to achieve scalability compared to sidechains. Only one honest verifier is required to keep an optimistic rollup secure; every other verifier could be dishonest and it wouldn't matter. Optimistic rollups need 1/n honest verifiers, and anyone can become a verifier, but sidechains need 1/2 honest validators, and not anyone can become a validator.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/mq3vhv9u9boa1.jpg?width=636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02bc9a52440196867d7f65f2bc99bb8e4cad86cfZero knowledge rollups don't even need verifiers, but their applications are limited, at least currently. Rollups are centralized as far as their sequencers go, but decentralized alternatives may emerge. Rollups can become fully decentralized, whereas sidechains cannot. Further, assets are retrievable from rollups even if the companies behind them stop operating. The same is not true for sidechains, where assets are irretrievable if the sidechain stops operating.Rollups are the best type of Layer 2 we have, and are seeing increasing prominence in Ethereum development. EIPs and upgrades are increasingly trying to make rollups even cheaper to use, in an effort to increase their capacity even more. In recent years, Ethereum has even moved to a rollup-centric roadmap.If an upgrade can make Layer 1 costs 10x cheaper, that could lead to 100x or even 1000x cost savings on rollups, or a capacity to handle that many more transactions. It therefore makes sense that rollups will facilitate an increasing share of Ethereum transactions.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/0wfxt3uz9boa1.jpg?width=521&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd86d77b0d9eba518ac7af1565317184e4ba50df&#x200B;# Layer 2's TodayRelatively speaking, sidechains are the easiest type of Layer 2 to deploy, and one that gives it's creators notable control. The Polygon Foundation was able to [increase gas fees](https://thedefiant.io/polygon-transaction-fee-hike) at a moment's notice to combat what they perceived to be on-chain spam. This centralized control also lead to the $622 million [hack of the Axie sidechain](https://decrypt.co/96322/hacker-622-million-axie-infinity-ronin-ethereum). Both a blessing and a curse, it is likely more sidechains will exist in the future. Their relative ease to develop is likely why we've seen sidechains emerge ahead of rollups.Optimism and Arbitrum publicly launched in 2021 and together have grown to hold over $5.5 billion in assets, as of today. Both are optimistic rollups and with many applications on them. Currently only Artbitrum, the larger of the two, is EVM-equivalent. While Optimism can execute most transactions the same way Ethereum would, but not all. Both networks require ETH to pay for gas. Companies including Starkware (previously Cairo) and Loopring are developing Zero-Knowledge rollups, with versions already live to the public, but limited in the types of transactions they can handle. The term zkEVM has been a buzzword recently as Zero Knowledge rollups continue trying to become EVM-equivalent, but it is not clear if this is possible. &#x200B;# In Conclusion&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/zuwwzq4iaboa1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e82ad015c4feee4fb5097fd4ff2ff0ed80055d2Naturally, Ethereum is limited. There's only so much block space for transactions, and there are very good reasons why expanding block size doesn't solve the problem (see my [Data Availability write-up here](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/merkle-trees-how-blockchain-data)). Instead, to allow more people to access the benefits of blockchain, we must expand the space we already have. This is what Layer 2's accomplish. Rollups make the least compromises, and will likely be Ethereum's foremost scaling solution.&#x200B;&#x200B;This write-up is a summary of the [full version available](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/guide-to-the-layer-2-landscape?sd=pf) on my free newsletter.

[Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/)) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of **self-custody** - namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all - without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.A close cousin of multisig wallets is [social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), where a single key can be used to sign transactions but if that key is lost, a group of keys held by other people can be used to recover the funds. Social recovery wallets are much easier than multisig wallets to use, especially with the rise of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) account abstraction and upcoming wallets like [Soul Wallet](https://twitter.com/zengjiajun_eth/status/1636496326723768320) that will make the technology user-friendly. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations's savings.Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on a concept of **guardians**: a set of N addresses, typically held by other people, of which any M can approve an operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians must sign a message to reset the key.**Two key questions in using multisig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?** This post will outline how I think about this issue. The ideas here should mostly apply equally to multisig and social recovery wallets being used to secure funds for individuals and for organizations.### What do we want out of guardians?* Minimize the chance that they lose their keys* Minimize the chance that they collude to steal your money, or get coerced into doing so* To the extent that the above two risks are unavoidable, the risk of each guardian should be maximally _uncorrelated_ - you want to minimize commonalities that risk situations that will disable or compromise too many of your guardians at the same time.This answer is simple and short, but it guides all of the choices that I make with regard to guardians.### It's okay for some of the guardians to be your own devices, but not too manyIt makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices - it doesn't reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it _is_ your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you're also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.My rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, **you should control at least 1 guardian, and at most N-M guardians**. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).### Choose guardians who do not often talk to each other or ideally do not know each otherIdeally, the guardians should not know who each other are. This greatly reduces the risk that they collude, and furthermore there is _no good reason_ for them to know each other. If something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people's minds in such a situation (eg. contact your family).Also, you want to **minimize correlations between your guardians as much as possible**: don't choose two guardians who live in the same city (or ideally even the same country), or two guardians who use the same type of wallet, and have a balance between different operating systems.### Guardians should ask a security question before approving an operationWhen you ask a guardian to approve an operation for you (in a multisig, this would be any transaction, and in a social recovery wallet, this would be resetting your account's key), they should not simply say yes immediately. This would be a disaster for security: if someone hacks into your chat account, they could scan your messages, figure out who your guardians are, contact each of them and ask them to confirm, and thereby steal your funds.My preferred protocol to avoid this is to instruct guardians to **ask a security question**. That is, when you ask for a confirmation on your operation, the guardian should ask you something that only the two of you and very few other people know (eg. 'the last time we met, what kind of food did we have?'), and only confirm the operation if you give the correct answer. A natural alternative is voice or video calls, but in the age of AI deepfakes this is weaker evidence than before, and so you may want to combine the voice/video call with asking some kind of security question.### If you're doing 'degen' stuff, make sure to have guardians who can respond quickly. Otherwise, this doesn't matterIf you're doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice (and therefore also, guardians in different time zones, so enough guardians to complete a transaction are awake at all times) to protect your funds. If you do not do these kinds of things, however, then speed is not particularly important, and in fact may even be slightly harmful, because convincing people of the need to act urgently is a common social engineering tactic used by hackers and it can be good to have people who are by default mentally averse to that.### Test each guardian at least once a yearMake a test operation at least once a year. Ideally, make two test operations each year, using half your guardians for one and the other half of your guardians for the other. This makes sure that your guardians haven't forgotten or lost their accounts.### Advanced: privacyOne of the challenges with guardians today is that the tech does not yet exist to make it possible to protect your financial privacy from your guardians. However, this is a technical problem that can be solved technically: instead of guarding your account directly, the guardians guard a 'lockbox' contract where the link between your account and the lockbox is hidden. Making the link stay hidden until a recovery needs to be made is pretty easy: for example, your account could have as a guardian a CREATE2 contract that only the lockbox can create. Making the link stay hidden _even after_ a recovery, however, requires more advanced ZK-SNARK tech. Hence, this is a problem that I expect will slowly be solved over the next few years.",False,How I think about choosing guardians for multisig and social recovery wallets,,4,304,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11tijiv/how_i_think_about_choosing_guardians_for_multisig/,[]

Somehow accidentally deleted it.Over the past I've come across multiple instances in the news, where motivated actors (govt, media, etc.) act against privacy tools and also privacy coins etc. You can find plenty of examples online on that - and there are even gag letters, which companies get where they are forced to implement certain backdoors into their cloud services and they're not allowed to tell anyone about it.And that's only the stuff we know about.With this agenda, privacy coins/tools like Monero, Tornado Cash, etc. ars also targeted. I won't discuss the relationship to money laundering now. But the point is, that these actors have lots of incentives to discourage widespread usage of these things. The popularity of bitcoin and ethereum is likely not too strongly attacked, because the Blockchains are completely public and it's easy for existing large scale data globbling systems to connect people via their KYC at exchanges to their wallet addresses.My hypothesis is, that when ethereum eventually moves to a privacy-by-default stealth address-based system, these actors will use lots of power and techniques to avoid this from happening. They could use all kinds of nice and not-so-nice techniques and for instance keep the ethereum foundation from actually working on this. As the saying goes (afaik). The bear won't attack you, as long as you don't attack/threaten it's power. The ethereum foundation would probably have been much more in cross-fire if ethereum had been privacy-first since the beginning.My worry is, that our goals of privacy in the future could get sabotaged/stopped - leaving us with an incomplete Blockchain and unfulfilled vision.Yes, there will be still privacy L2s and smart contracts. But they don't work as good, if they are opt-in. After NSA revelations, everyone started taking encryption seriously. Encryption is opt-out now. All by default is encrypted.

(**IdenaAnnouncement**) The group didn't look suspicious, and it even had a history of previous news from the project. I assumed that it was a real announcement channel (**IdenaAnnouncements**), but I failed to notice that it was actually a group and not a channel. The scammers had put restrictions on every member so that they couldn't write anything. As you can see the difference in names between the fake one and the real one is only in one letter '`s'`.I followed the link, and the website looked quite professional. However, it requested access to my MetaMask wallet. Since I didn't have much money in it, I assumed that the official channel couldn't do any scam. I had been in this project for years. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a contract that took all of my money (about $47).Here are some key takeaways from my experience that might help others avoid getting scammed:1. Adjust your privacy settings to prevent anyone from adding you to groups without your consent.2. Scammers are increasingly personalizing their attacks, parsing group members and imposing restrictions on them individually.3. They also create fake members to make the group appear genuine and lure people into clicking on links.4. The name of the fake group might be very similar to the original one, with just a small difference in spelling.5. Always check is it a group with restrictions or is it a channel?I realize now that I made a mistake, but scammers are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. It's important to be cautious and vigilant to protect ourselves from their schemes.I hope that my message helped people avoid being potentially scammed.**The scammers addresses:***0xD53f5c2cA654F291a44E611e17F42347660Faf66**0x51cbfc2770c3835eda70e883898c013fa5b2a08e***The scammers website:**meta-multichain.tech",False,"I was scammed because the scam didn't look like a scam. ✧ Besides my own foolishness, scammers are becoming smarter.",,1,224,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11rnz81/i_was_scammed_because_the_scam_didnt_look_like_a/,[]

Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

This is bad, and you should feel bad. Let's use Rai more, and here's a way to do it.# USDC is a crutchRecent events with Dai and USDC prove yet again why stablecoins backed by USD are toxic assets. The reality, [as Arthur Hayes put it](https://youtu.be/vSvVkm7gViE?t=2518), is that DeFi will always be hamstrung if we depend on US dollar stability. It introduces centralization risks, and also draws the ire of regulators who want bond stability. When you realize all liquid stablecoins are backed mostly by US treasury bonds, guarded by centralized commercial banks, you realize just how this house of cards can fall. When certain market conditions are met, the bonds are liquidated at market rates, where you may receive $0.94 on every dollar.**Oh wait, that's what just happened**You can do research on bond mechanics and how the combination of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank destroyed the value of USDC, but look no further than the PSM on Dai to see how destructive this crutch is. [It currently stands at 63% USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) as everyone panic sold USDC for Dai to get out of fears that Circle was undercollateralized, [which it turns out they are](https://www.circle.com/blog/an-update-on-usdc-and-silicon-valley-bank). # Stop using USDC challengeNow here's the hard part. I know you want to larp as a decentralization maxi, but it's time to stop it and actually be a decentralization maxi. Here's how you can do it.## As a userAs a user, how can you promote Rai? By actually using Rai. Instead of going to conferences and larping about how great ETH is, but then splitting bills with Venmo, why don't use use Rai?- Buy some Rai- Use it to split bills with other DeFi native people.I understand risks that it could go down, so just use Rai in a small fashion just to get used to it. You don't need to go crazy and buy $100K in Rai, but keep a small amount on a layer 2 and slosh it around.## As a DeFi trader.Big bag boys, have I got news for you. Rai is currently paying you to generate it. As it stands, it has [over 4% APY](https://stats.reflexer.finance/) to mint new RAI. How does it work? [The stability peg is currently negative](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd).- Make a Reflexer Safe and generate Rai. Long ETH using Reflexer bonds.- Take the Rai and market make with it. Preferably on L2s.Now here's the interesting part? Want leverage? Use DeFi Saver to mint new RAI and rebuy ETH. [You can do this in 1 swap and have some good capital efficiency](https://app.defisaver.com/reflexer/manage).## As a Project OwnerThis is an interesting part. You're a project owner, so you have sweet yield farming rewards for people who want to use your project. I want to ask, why are you using anything else but Rai as the base token in your project? Why are you doing ICOs with USDC? Why is your NFT project selling in Dai/USDC and not even giving the option for Rai? Rai is right there. Use it. Help bootstrap Rai liquidity. Why should you do this you ask? Well even if you complain about the possibility of Rai going down in value, considering this weekend USDC dropped to $0.88, you clearly do not have the safety you think you have. You have just as much volatility risk as Rai already, except you also have the trust risk where you hope to god Circle or the Bitfinex Cartel actually has the bonds they say they do. You are effectively ignoring your risks, while Rai's risks are right in front of you and clear. You're just risking your project, and may wake up one day with $0.50 on every USDC. Here's an idea:- Stop doing token raises with USDC. Use Rai.- Generate yield farm liquidity with Rai. Preferably run your yield farm programs on L2s so general users can access Rai.- Promote Rai. Use Rai as payment tokens for your merch. Support Rai in your app as a base token. Use Rai as a payment for conferences. Enjoy Rai within your organization and offer it as salaries.# FinIf you've made it this far, I hope you're now thinking. You're all far too deep into USD stablecoins, and you don't realize you are not supporting decentralized finance. Every USD has a link to a commercial US bank, regulated by the government, and will always be crutched by regulators who manage bond volatility. The next few weeks, you will see people use the recent bank failures as an excuse to regulate these tokens further, as they are directly linked to US treasuries markets. This is foolish. Simplify your risks. Rai is risky, but it's simplified risks backed by pure ETH.**We need you to help promote Rai**The hard part? You're not going to get rich doing it. It's not like promoting your digital beanie babies or new yield farm. It won't make you a token billionaire. No one is making a yield farm strategy for Rai, because it's already mostly crystalized. The project owners aren't going to get rich from it, and neither will you. It's an already deployed token, that has been in the wild for over a year, that's just sitting there waiting for you to realize it's use. Use it.# A note from SatoshiThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.- Satoshi Nakamoto, [Bitcoin Release Memo](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/1/#selection-45.1-45.539)# Additional Readings[Why Rai was better than Terra](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/05/25/stable.html)[Stability Without Pegs](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)[Rai Whitepaper](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/whitepapers/blob/master/English/rai-english.pdf)",False,Stop using USDC challenge and use Rai ( not impossible),,0,8,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11pfhoq/stop_using_usdc_challenge_and_use_rai_not/,[]

This is not surprising, considering the numerous benefits that the Ethereum blockchain offers over others imo. Some of the key benefits of the Ethereum blockchain include:* **Smart contract functionality**: Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to introduce smart contracts which allows for the automation of complex business and financial processes without the need for intermediaries. * **Developer community**: Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities which has resulted in the creation of a number of libraries, tools and frameworks making it easier for gaming developers to build here. * **Flexibility**: Ethereum is a highly flexible platform which allows the creation of a wide range of dApps going beyond financial applications and towards the gaming sector too, making it more ideal.  * **Interoperability**: Ethereum's compatibility with other blockchains through its use of smart contract programming languages like Vyper allows for the construction of decentralized applications (including games) that can interact with multiple blockchain networks. Some examples of popular games built on Ethereum blockchain include:  1) **Axie Infinity**'- a popular game that allows players to collect, breed, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies.  2) **Gods Unchained**'-  a digital trading card game that allows players to collect and battle with unique cards.  3) **Vulcan Verse**'- an open world blockchain game built by Vulcan Forged where you can travel around and interact with games and events.   4) **The Sandbox**'- a virtual world that allows players to buy and sell virtual land and assets.Overall, in addition to the above-mentioned features, its decentralization, transparency and security make it an idea platform for building games involving digital assets and its benefits are clear.

We've recently launched our website and our first game is now available to play!Our goal is to create a platform where multiple games can be played, and users on the platform can earn governance tokens for engaging. With these tokens, users can create proposals or vote on created proposals to steer the direction of the platform. This includes gameplay balancing, development of new games, steering of the community treasury, and layer 2 solutions.Our first game revolves around the care and growth of 'Charlys,' which are dynamic NFTs used as the basis for characters. Players can clean, feed, and play a mini-game in Unity with their minted characters, and with enough care, players can evolve their characters, enhancing their attributes and changing their visual appearance. We're currently working on a battle game where users can compete with their evolved characters against each other and AI.To kickstart our decentralization process, we'll be launching an Airdrop Campaign soon. We believe the only way to achieve true decentralization is to distribute tokens fairly and get as many people as possible to participate. We have a plan for this that we'll be sharing in the coming days.I'd love to hear your constructive criticism or answer any questions you may have.

I'm fairly new, so please understand,if my question is already resolved/easy to answer.WalletConnect is the most widely used standard for dapps and wallets to be agnostic to the concrete counterparty they are connecting to. I was asking myself, how resillient this setup is.For instance, if a dapp's UI is hosted on ipfs and it connects via metamask, then that connection is directly via the browser and local (afaik), and it cannot be intercepted (assuming browser not hacked etc.).However, with WalletConnect there are relays running on wallet-connects servers which make this concrete connection between the dapp and the wallet. This is a centralised security/censorship issue. [As far as I can see, it's not possible to host these relays yourself at the moment.](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/faq). I also don't know the specifics of WalletConnect relays. What is the worst thing that can happen, if they become compromised? Can compromised servers deny people using a dapp? Can compromised servers make nasty things via mitm attacks?I am aware, that the direct interaction with the smart contract can happen without the UI. But I don't think that the majority of users in crypto can actually do that when in emergency.Given the value of decentralisation and Trustlessness, I am not sure, whether the widespread of WalletConnect relays is really all that ok. After all, if a powerful actor wants, they might approach the WalletConnect and force them to change their servers to do a specific thing.It would be great, if this couldn't be used for censorship just like the tornado cash was blacklisted.What do you think?

We are already starting to see the early excitement build up around ZKEVMs and other zero knowledge projects, the odds are that any you happen upon will be built on top of mathematics that Mary has contributed to. * https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gzHDMSYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao * Scalability Solutions from zk SNARKs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UfD4Mp6EM * The Roaring Twenties: Recent Advances in Zero-Knowledge Proofs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZAOt6_fZ1k------**Anett Rolikova**Self-described 'Ethereum Sunshine', Anett has contributed to a bunch of projects, probably the most useful to me personally being her 'curated crypto list', which serves as an unbeatable starting place for anyone getting started in their Ethereum journey.

She has written a book on the early days of Ethereum called *'The Infinite Machine'* which is currently being made into a movie by Ridley Scott's studio... yea that Ridley Scott studios, who also produced Alien, Gladiator, Bladerunner and some of the other most popular movies of all time! The story is pretty fascinating, and when the movie comes out it should take Ethereum another big step towards wider recognition in the general public. * https://thedefiant.io/scott-free-infinite-machineShe also founded and runs one of the most trustworthy crypto news sources - The Defiant.

They have always done their research and the questions asked demonstrate a level of understanding that makes it almost impossible for the listener to come away without learning from every episode. You should be a listener if you want a general crypto podcast that never seems like the guests are just being allowed to hype up their projects. * https://epicenter.tv/hosts/friederike-ernst/She is also the COO of Gnosis, the scaling solution formerly known as xDAI, that POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) run on. POAPs are collectable badges that have become an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem, if you watch a big event live (like The Merge) then you can usually get a POAP, if you participate in a DAO governance call then you can usually get a POAP, if you go to an Ethereum conference then you will probably end up with a walletful of POAPs! Gnosis is also home to plenty of other dApps, a nicely decentralized staking community and all the usual sort of things a sidechain would want. * Gnosis Chain: Extending Ethereum [ETHCC 5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYVOE3P08eU------**Jinglan Wang**Jinglan is a Co-Founder and the Chief Executive Officer of Optimism, currently the second biggest Ethereum L2, recently in the news for a partnership with Coinbase over the Optimism Stack, and pioneers in retroactive public goods funding, DAO governance, and a series of massive airdrops to L2 users/Gitcoin donors/DAO participants etc. Disclaimer, I'm a delegate to Optimism and a Citizen's House badgeholder, so I won't go on about how great the project is as I'm definitely a biased source. * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8ycNV0lF5MShe is also a founder and advisor to the Blockchain Education Network, one of the biggest outreach programs in crypto, helping schools, clubs etc around the world teach people about this new technology. * https://www.blockchainedu.org/------**Taylor Monahan**If you were around in Ethereum before 'The DAO' or joined any time up to the first ICO mania then you are pretty likely to remember Taylor, even if you didn't know here name. She was one of the founders of the first easy to use Ethereum wallet (My Ether Wallet), before which we had to wait to sync the chain before making transactions (was that Parity, Myst, ?, I don't remember). This was an absolute game changer and allowed many more people to start accessing Ethereum... just in time for them to faced with a barrage of new 'Initial Coin Offerings', investments with varying degrees of legitimacy. As well as being partially responsible for enabling the chaos that ensued, Taylor also took it upon herself to try and call out scams and terrible investment 'opportunities' that newbies were falling for. If you look her up on Twitter you'll see that she still is still doing this, though now working for the ecosystem's current main wallet Metamask. * How to Avoid Crypto Scams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiYYQCs49VM * The Original Sin [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OnxjlA-RKA------**Pulja Ohlhaver**Pulja has become well more know in the Ethereum community following the publication of the paper 'Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul', of which she is a co-author. This was what sparked the conversations around soul-bound tokens and their uses in the middle of last year, it also talks about the state and future of many aspects of the space that are key to governance, such as Sybil resistance, quadratic funding and social recovery wallets, all of which are becoming increasingly important in DAOs and Web 3.0 in general. * https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763She is a big picture / long game thinker for what the crypto ecosystem could become, if we can navigate our way there without falling into corporate/governmental control on one side of the ridge or fraudsters and scams on the other. If you haven't read the paper yet then I highly recommend it, or at the very least listen to her explain it. * Bottom up Building: Pathways towards a Decentralized Society [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JpBmA-8FVcLike everyone else on this list, Pulja has a variety of other contributions, such as being the Strategy Counsel at FlashBots (the MEV research and development organization). * https://www.flashbots.net/------ **Simona Pop**Simona is a DAO governance and public good thought-leader and advocate; a key contributor to Gitcoin (the biggest public goods funding platform in the ecosystem) and the organizer of Schelling Point (probably the biggest 'regen' conference). She was also a co-founder of 'Bounties Network', a platform similar(ish) to 'Fiver' for Web3.0 where freelancers can be paid for doing everything from finding a bug in some code, translating documentation t another language or even planting a tree... she's one of the many people in Ethereum community working hard to realize a vision of a better future, by building it. * https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/activity/topics  * https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/info  * DAOs and Biomimicry [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0I5dkkpJ9o------So over to you I guess, who have I missed?",False,Gratitude to women who have made huge contributions to the ecosystem - who are you thankful for?,,1,10,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11lslel/gratitude_to_women_who_have_made_huge/,[]

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

To keep this validator set healthy, it should be protected from any drastic changes in number for security. If the number of validators could increase or decrease very quickly, this could be employed as a tactic in orchestrating an attack. https://preview.redd.it/8td8awbkrjla1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1b4adf7facc14aa97c8db216953459814fd2e8fA party could potentially exit a large number of validators, immediately causing a scare and others to exit, then instantly activate twice the amount of validators and gain significant control over the network. If there were no buffers to exit and entry, this could be a serious vulnerability to Ethereum. Beyond the queues, there are additional penalties to those that perform a malicious action (like proposing two different blocks at once) and are slashed.&#x200B;# Unstaking on EthereumThe Shanghai hard fork introduces withdrawals for which information is written into a new space on Ethereum blocks, without the need to pay for gas. There are two queues withdrawers must go through to withdraw their ETH. The first is the exit queue and is somewhat slow, the other is the withdrawal queue and is much faster.https://preview.redd.it/bxr5idw2sjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4624231b38e2d29bd543abe7b32815ccbaffa6d4The slower exit queue is only necessary to enter if a validator is trying to withdraw all of their staked ETH (the principal + rewards), in which case it's called a full withdrawal. The exit queue allows 7-8 full withdrawals to happen every 32 blocks. The number of withdrawals permitted in such a period is called the churn limit, and increases as more validators become active. Once a validator intending a full withdrawal goes through this exit queue, they'll arrive in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators (approximately 1/5th of the current set) 63 days to go through the exit queue.The faster withdrawal queue processes a maximum of 16 full or partial withdrawals every block (or every 12 seconds). A partial withdrawal happens automatically and disburses rewards earned by validators to addresses they designate to receive those rewards. Both of these are viewed as being equal in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators 20 hours to go through the withdrawal queue.There is a prerequisite to entering either of the queues above: validators must ensure that withdrawal addresses are updated and refer to valid addresses on Ethereum (technically, in the 0x01 format). This can be done now, and doing so will place rewards for those validators in the withdawal queue automatically once Shanghai goes live.&#x200B;# Impacts of UnstakingWhile likely that many will want to unstake their ETH initially, the capacity for validators to withdraw is throttled. The reason is so that the validator set doesn't change too drastically in too short a time. For the same reason, a queue exists to begin staking ETH. This also impacts the price of ETH, which won't see the supply dump many prophesize.https://preview.redd.it/7bis8l4trjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfa6319f9584eef98ba10a014ae0f18ef987ebb7It is likely that even amongst those who unstake, a significant portion will start staking again shortly thereafter. This is because many will be shifting from one staking service to another, something they can't do until they unstake first. A further incentive is in the rewards rate, which increases as the validator set gets smaller.Finally, the automatic disbursement of rewards will be exciting to look forward to. It introduces new liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem directly, as opposed to having it locked up with the ETH that's being staked. Ever since the Merge happened, validators have not received their rewards for validating the blockchain, the rewards are locked with the staked ETH. The additional '~0.2 ETH per block added directly into the ecosystem should have some interesting effects.# In ConclusionIt's fascinating that staking withdrawals are right around the corner. The conversation around whether to include withdrawals in the Shanghai hard fork was a big reason this newsletter started. It seemed necessary that as many of us in Ethereum as possible be knowledgeable about upcoming upgrades so that we can lend our support to the ones we consider most important.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/2asqa9xlrjla1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=abd7fa1e14d1b6b4d16eea2527263fe5424fc2bd&#x200B;This is a summary of the full write-up available on my free newsletter!

The company does not send the items, the user can request the 80$ back through the smart contract;2. The company sends the items, the user confirms the items when he receives them, all is well;3. The company sends the items, they are defective, the user does not confirm the items and requests the 80$ back through the smart contract;4. The user does not pay 90$ but only 80$ (doesn't use MetaMask, manually buy the items); the order would be registered in the smart contract, but the company sees that the user has not paid the correct amount for the shipping costs and decides to not send the item (obviously it would also notify the user for that). The user can still request its 80$ back through the smart contract.So worst case scenario the user would lose the shipping costs, granted I don't add another mechanic so that the user can ask a refund on that cost as well, and then the company will then have the right to accept such refund case by case.It seems to me this approach kinda tries to minimize the risks for both actors, but I want to know your opinion on it.

New Jersey is considering a bill that could make it illegal to sell NFTs without a license. The Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act proposes to prohibit engaging in digital asset business activities without being licensed by the department. This means that artists who simply want to sell a piece of art as an NFT will need a license.While this legislation might seem like it only affects residents of New Jersey, it could have wider implications. Selling NFTs has become increasingly popular, with many artists and creators using them as a way to monetize their work. If this bill passes, it could set a precedent for other states or even countries to introduce similar legislation.The bill not only requires a license for holding, storing, or maintaining custody of a digital asset on behalf of others but also for issuing a digital asset, such as creating a smart contract that sells an NFT. This means that anyone who wants to sell NFTs, even as a hobby or a one-time thing, would need to go through the licensing process.The repercussions of this legislation are far-reaching. Not only would it be impractical and unreasonable for artists to have to go to a dingy office in North Jersey to fill out paperwork and receive a certificate just to sell an NFT, but violators would also face a hefty fee.The proposed legislation has sparked controversy and criticism, with many people expressing concerns about the impact it could have on the NFT market. It also brings up questions about how much regulation is necessary in the world of digital assets and whether this bill is a step too far.In the words of Twitter user Degen Doobz, 'remember the saying, 'first they came for the New Jersey Pepe derivative NFTs, and I did not speak out because I was not from NJ. Then they came for my Pepe derivative NFTs, and there was no one left to speak for me.' This legislation will have repercussions for everyone.'It remains to be seen whether this bill will pass and what the future holds for the NFT market. However, it is clear that the digital world is evolving rapidly, and it is up to lawmakers to find a balance between regulation and innovation.If you wanna learn more I post a free weekly newsletter here: [https://poetryofprogress.substack.com/](https://poetryofprogress.substack.com/)",False,🚨BREAKING: New law makes it ILLEGAL to hold NFTs (not a joke),,0,0,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11d2y8j/breaking_new_law_makes_it_illegal_to_hold_nfts/,[]

I have done a lot of reading but still find myself scratching my head around the intricacies of censorship as it pertains MEV.My understanding is that ever since the merge, when Ethereum went from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, the process in which blocks are built have created a vector for censorship. MEV or Maxium Extractible Value is a sort of strategy where the block builders (miners or validators) can rearrange, include, or exclude transactions to maximize their profits. '**MEV Boost'** acts as a mediator that can be used to give the validators a fair share of the MEV extracted.The problem is that MEV Boost is also complying with OFAC sanctions and has a blacklist of ethereum addresses that have been sanctioned by OFAC. Validators who run MEV Boost are effectively excluding any OFAC sanctioned Ethereum addresses from being added to a new block, which is censoring those addresses from interacting with the ethereum protocol.My questions are:1. Is my understanding above correct?2. Why did this become an issue post merge, how come Proof of Work did not have the same issues of censorship?3. Are those OFAC sanctioned Ethereum addresses completely blocked from transacting or are they just being ignored by the validators that are running MEV boost but they can still get included in Blocks from validators that are not complying with OFAC sanctions?4. On the [mevwatch.info](https://mevwatch.info/) website it has a 'censorship offenders leaderboard' which lists the validators that are censoring transactions. I noticed the biggest offenders are the largest validators like LIDO, Coinbase, Binance. I am assuming they are required to block these transactions, however it appears that only some of their validators are censoring transactions. For example: for Coinbase it shows that they have roughly 800 validators, however only 472 are censored which is 58% of their validators. Whats the deal with this?

Here are some other actions the IRS can take before resorting to jail time.1. Did you know that many exchanges already report to the IRS? When they send out 1099 forms, the IRS also gets a copy. If you decide not to report your crypto activity, you'll be first in line for a crypto tax audit!2. The IRS can assess a 20% accuracy-related penalty on understated tax. For example, if you didn't report your crypto and you owed $5,000 in taxes, the accuracy-related penalty would be $1,000. This penalty can be assessed for negligence or disregard for the rules.3. If the IRS does audit you and find you guilty of tax fraud, they can assess a 75% fraud penalty of the unpaid tax. This can even be done without opening a criminal investigation.4. What's the worst case scenario? Prison! Any attempt to cheat the IRS can be considered tax evasion or tax fraud. Both of these are felonies and can have a maximum penalty of $100,000 and 5 years in prison per each tax year.Bottom line is to always report your crypto!

This can be done in the event of a hack, which is easily solved by changing an account's signer.# Multicall TransactionsSince all accounts (i.e. our wallets) can have custom code, that can be used to bundle transactions together, just like the way smart contracts do. This means a token swap or NFT purchase takes 1 operation, instead of up to 4. This eliminates the need for infinite approvals, as everything necessary happens in one transaction, while also reducing gas costs for users.# Session KeysThanks to custom code, wallets can authorize platforms to perform specific functions for a set amount of time. This can make using exchanges or playing blockchain based games won't require authorization every time a repeated task is performed. It's instead authorized for some time to do those things by the session key.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/wi2pqxcvm6ka1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c02d441787985998662e9f2802c3dcb829b258f# Social RecoveryWith social recovery, anyone can appoint a number of guardian accounts. If a signer for a wallet is ever compromised, the guardians could vote to change the signer for that account themselves. Guardians can be added or removed by the signer themselves, but with a time delay. This presents an opportunity to recover a wallet from a compromise by depending on others you trust.# MFAMulti-Factor Authentication becomes possible, with an operation requiring approvals from several accounts before actually happening. While this is similar to milt-signature wallets, it is different. Multi-signature wallets are actually smart contracts that perform operations when several people authorize them. Account Abstraction on the other hand grants that ability directly to all wallets.https://preview.redd.it/ifou29p7l6ka1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=291b542df7939e99c7930de7a5ced70470b28bb2# Key RotatorThis presents the possibility of buying and selling accounts, since signers for those accounts can be changed. This could allow for the safe transfer of wallets with whitelists for upcoming NFT mints or even soulbound tokens, making them not so soulbound anymore.# Code Custom LogicWallets can have custom code which can be used to enhance or alter the functoins they perform. This custom code could be built by anyone and made available to the public as plugins. Imagine an App Store that added additional functionality to your wallet. That becomes possible.# Signers for Different OperationsWallets can have instances that are specific to the device they're on, only authorized to perform specific transactions. This could allow anyone to have a wallet on their phone that can only perform very basic operations, have spend limits, and cannot perform a transfer. An instance of a wallet on a home computer could be given broader access.# Gas in Other CurrenciesWith wallets having custom code, any currency can be used to pay for gas fees. Someone could pay for gas with USDC, for example. What actually happens is that the currency is swapped into ETH and used to pay for gas fees, all in the same transaction.# Spam FilterA spam filter also becomes a possibility, wherein anyone can permit inbound transfers to their wallet only from authorized sources. There will likely be services that compile safe senders, allowing anyone to import a list into their wallet of addresses that can make transfers to them.

However, the network has been facing some challenges in terms of scalability and transaction fees. In response, the Ethereum community has been exploring different solutions to address these issues, and one of them is the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). In this thread, we'll take a closer look at how zkEVM interacts with Ethereum Layer 1.Firstly, it's important to understand what zkEVM is. It's a layer 2 solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain, which helps to reduce gas costs and increase transaction throughput. In other words, zkEVM allows for more transactions to be processed without congesting the Ethereum network. However, it's not a standalone solution and needs to interact with the Ethereum Layer 1.The interaction between zkEVM and Ethereum Layer 1 happens through smart contracts. When a user wants to use zkEVM, they first need to create a smart contract on the Ethereum network. This contract is called a 'zkSync contract,' and it's used to lock up ETH or ERC-20 tokens. Once the tokens are locked, the user can interact with zkEVM to execute transactions off-chain.When a transaction is executed on zkEVM, it's verified through zero-knowledge proofs, which are then submitted to the zkSync contract on the Ethereum Layer 1. The zkSync contract then updates the user's balance on Ethereum Layer 1, reflecting the transaction that was executed off-chain. This means that the transaction is validated on Ethereum Layer 1, even though it was executed off-chain through zkEVM.In summary, zkEVM interacts with Ethereum Layer 1 through smart contracts. It allows for more transactions to be processed off-chain, which helps to reduce gas costs and increase transaction throughput. However, the transactions are still validated on Ethereum Layer 1 through a zkSync contract, ensuring their security and validity. As the Ethereum community continues to explore different solutions to address scalability and transaction fees, zkEVM is emerging as a promising solution that could help to address these challenges.",False,Understanding the Interaction between zkEVM and Ethereum Layer 1,,0,19,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11apllx/understanding_the_interaction_between_zkevm_and/,[]

It essentially serves as collateral; if a validator makes a mistake, such as proposing two blocks at once, they will lose some of the currency at stake (or be slashed, in other words).Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) make staked funds liquid and usable for other purposes. This is accomplished by issuing tokens that represent the ETH staked. When a user stakes ETH with an LSD provider, they will receive (ERC-20) tokens that allow them to redeem their deposit.  Before Ethereum, LSDs existed on other chains, such as Kusama/Polkadot, where unstacking can take up to 28 days. The popularity of LSD on Ethereum stems from the fact that it was previously unknown when withdrawals/unstacking would be possible. Ethereum withdrawals have now been confirmed as part of the Shanghai upgrade in March and will be covered in greater detail in a future write-up.&#x200B;**How Do LSDs Work?**The cToken model is used by the majority of LSDs. When you stake 1 ETH, you will receive 1 tokenETH, a token representing your deposit. The ETH deposited is pooled and grows as it accumulates rewards. You can get your deposit and share of the rewards back by exchanging tokenETH for ETH.&#x200B;There is no 1:1 ratio between the token and the staked asset in LSD systems. There will always be fewer tokenETH than there are ETH. As the amount of ETH staked grows with rewards, so does the amount that can be redeemed with tokenETH. This is why LSD token prices aren't always the same as ETH prices at any given time.  Staking on ETH and receiving rewards on that staked ETH on a regular basis is an alternative to LSD. This can be accomplished by directly staking 32 ETH or by participating in programs that offer to stake but do not provide a token in exchange. The rewards are paid out in ETH based on the performance of the validator.Staking with Coinbase, for example, provides a user with a 3% yield in ETH. Alternatively, you can participate in the LSD and receive cbETH tokens after you stake with Coinbase. When you do this, you will no longer directly accumulate ETH rewards; instead, you will exchange the cbETH for ETH in exchange for a share of the pool's rewards.## Providers of LSDThere are various LSD providers, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. There are up to 20 staking services to choose from, with up to 7 offering an LSD, according to Beaconchain. From most centralized to least centralized, here are the major LSD providers and a brief explanation of each.## Exchanges that are centralisedThere are centralized exchanges that provide LSDs; these are the simplest but also the most expensive solutions. Fees on centralized exchanges can reach up to 30% — that is, 30% of rewards go to Coinbase before the rest is distributed to stakes.When staking with a centralized exchange, the nodes are entirely run by their employees. The cToken model is used by exchanges such as Coinbase. To exchange the LSD ETH for regular ETH, centralized exchanges required identity verification or KYC.## LIDOLIDO is one of the first Ethereum LSD providers. They allow anyone to stake any amount of ETH in exchange for stETH. The LIDO DAO appoints potential validators and distributes ETH to them. LIDO takes 10% of rewards, with half going to validators and the other half going to a DAO treasury to be used as needed.The cToken model described above is not used by LIDO. Instead, the DAO chooses oracles to aggregate the balances of all validators using LIDO ETH. The supply of stETH is then adjusted based on whether there is a net increase or decrease. If a day ends with more rewards, stETH is distributed. Otherwise, some stETH is burned. The supply of stETH is adjusted in this manner on a daily basis.## Pool of RocketsStakers and node operators are two types of independent participants in Rocket Pool. Stakers can deposit any amount they want, while node operators must have at least 16 ETH. Stakers contribute 16 ETH to node operators, which is used to set up a validator node. Node operators receive 15% of the rewards generated for ETH staked on others' behalf.Only stakers, not node operators, receive the rETH LSD in Rocket Pool. This means that node operators get paid directly, whereas stakers get paid the LSD way: by exchanging rETH for ETH. The cToken model is used by Rocket Pool's LSD.Rocket Pool's upcoming Atlas upgrade will allow node operators to participate by depositing 8 ETH rather than the current 16.Finally, LSDs allows you to be in two places at the same time. Staking ETH can generate yield, and a token equivalent can be used in DeFi to generate additional yield. LSDs' flexibility makes them an appealing option for many new stakeholders. They come at the expense of some lost reward fees, but the benefit is the flexibility and the elimination of the need to set up a validator node at home.   It is my hope that LSD providers will make staking more accessible in the future, and that more people will be able (and willing) to set up their own nodes. There is a serious risk of centralized LSD providers staking too much ETH, but they allow many newcomers to participate in staking.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

Blockchain games set themselves apart from traditional video games by providing players free crypto, NFTs or other assets which can ultimately be exchanged for fiat currencies. With the rise in popularity of AI, Metaverse and NFT based tokens, we can expect a similar trend to spillover in the blockchain P2E space too. The market is saturated with all sorts of P2E games, a lot of which may not ultimately prove to be worth one's time and effort. However, after searching the market for a good bit, heres a quick look at my top 10 p2e blockchain games that seem to be worthwhile. 1) **Illuvium (ILV)** is a sci-fi adventure NFT creature collector and autobattler game that enables players to explore 7 alien landscapes. Players uncover the events that shattered Illuvium and can hunt and capture over 100 deadly beasts that rule the alien territory.2) **Alien Worlds (TLM)** is one of the best P2E games, attracting more than 3.6 million users since inception and more than 700,000 monthly players. It's another sci-fi game that enables players to explore space and scrub various planets for resources.3) **The Sandbox (SAND)** is of the top P2E games that enable players to choose from more than 140,000 avatars is The Sandbox. Players use their avatars to play in the Sandbox and to build, own and monetize their piece of LAND. 4) **Axie Infinity (AXS)** many gamers consider Axie Infinity as the pioneering platform of play to earn blockchain games. This NFT game enables players to collect and mint NFTs, which represent digital pets known as Axies.5) **Vulcan Verse (PYR)**  is a decentralized open world blockchain game where you can travel around and interact with games and events. Vulcan Forged, one of the leading platforms in this space is the blockchain gaming studio that has developed this game. The MMORPG game is built using blockchain technology and consists of land parcels represented by NFTs.6) **Decentraland (MANA)** is the first virtual world owned by its users, enabling them to create, explore and buy LAND, a plot in the Metaverse. Players can explore LANDs to experience majestic scenery such as medieval dungeon mazes and villages. 7) **Battle Infinity (IBAT)** proved since its presale that it would be one of the best P2E games to watch this year. The key attraction of Battle Infinity is earning rewards on 6 platforms. Players can enter the IBAT Premier League and build up teams to compete for rewards. Another way to earn is by monetizing land. 8) **RobotEra (TARO)** is a promising new play-to-earn crypto game that puts earning opportunities directly in the hands of the people. Players can explore a vast virtual land, acquiring resources and turning a profit along the way.9) **Lucky Block (LBLOCK)** is a popular cryptocurrency ecosystem that has just launched a new casino and sportsbook offering more than 2,700 games, sports betting, enticing bonuses and no fees.10) **Tamadoge (TAMA)** this is a promising P2E game since its early in its roadmap with high potential in the long term. Its native token TAMA is also a meme coin that separates itself from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by having a real world utility. Players can earn TAMA tokens by exercising, feeding and nurturing their pets.What are your thoughts on this?

However, as the network grows, it is becoming increasingly clear that the existing infrastructure may not be able to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for transactions.Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks are two different types of Ethereum networks that offer different features and capabilities. L1 is the main Ethereum blockchain, which is used for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. It is the backbone of the entire Ethereum ecosystem and is responsible for securing the network.On the other hand, L2 networks are built on top of L1 and are designed to improve the scalability and speed of transactions. They are often referred to as 'off-chain' solutions because they allow transactions to be processed outside of the main blockchain. L2 networks offer faster transaction processing times, lower fees, and greater scalability than L1, making them an attractive option for users who want to save time and money.As the Ethereum network continues to grow, many users are starting to shift towards L2 solutions to overcome the limitations of the L1 network. With the current congestion and high fees on the L1 network, many users are finding it challenging to use the network for small transactions, which has led to a growing interest in L2 networks.The idea of having L1 networks reserved for large businesses and institutions while L2 networks interact exclusively with each other has been gaining traction among the Ethereum community. This approach could help to reduce the strain on the L1 network and improve the scalability of the overall network. Additionally, it could lead to increased adoption of L2 solutions, as users become more comfortable with off-chain transactions.One of the primary benefits of using L2 networks is that they allow for instant transactions at a significantly lower cost than L1. This makes them an attractive option for users who need to make small transactions frequently. However, the current challenge is that L2 networks are still in their early stages, and not all applications are compatible with them.There are several types of L2 solutions, including state channels, plasma, and sidechains. Each of these solutions has its unique features, and some are better suited for specific use cases than others. For example, state channels are ideal for games and micropayments, while plasma is better suited for more complex transactions that require more processing power.Despite the advantages of L2 networks, there are some challenges that must be addressed before they can become a viable alternative to L1. One of the most significant challenges is interoperability between different L2 solutions. Currently, there is no standardization for L2 networks, which can make it challenging for them to work together seamlessly.In conclusion, the idea of reserving L1 networks for large businesses and institutions while L2 networks interact exclusively with each other is an intriguing concept that could help to reduce the strain on the L1 network and improve the scalability of the overall network. However, this will require a significant amount of collaboration and innovation within the Ethereum community to develop new standards and protocols for L2 networks. With the current pace of development and the increasing interest in L2 solutions, it is likely that we will see significant progress in this area over the next few years.",False,Embracing L2 Networks: A Future Where Ethereum's L1 is Reserved for Enterprises and L2s Interact Exclusively with Each Other,,0,2,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/111veqh/embracing_l2_networks_a_future_where_ethereums_l1/,[]

Where NFT games cost tons of money to play, and while they're fun, are just way too unaffordable.Enter, The Game of Life, on Ethereum. Most NFT games are super engaging, and want you to play every day, like the trillions of games, on Ethereum and non-crypto based. I propose a situation that puts the focus on *you*, and your progression as a human being. From birth, we are born into the ideal of what our parents believe in, they teach us things, and they give us advice. When we reach adulthood, we lead almost boring lives, filled with work, and the upsides of life, like Ethereum! The Game of Life was one of my favorite childhood games to play and made you experience this Tomodachi mini-me who had to face life's problems, and maybe win the lottery or buy a swanky house.What if, on Ethereum, your life could be documented and gamified into your own board. You play by your rules, get your first job, move somewhere new, or get married. All of these life events would be documented onchain, but not the Google stuff, your birthday or your name. The stuff that *really* matters, like your major life events. When you die, you won't be left with a gravestone, but a history of *you*, who you were, forever lasting on the blockchain. Your move to Germany or Japan would last forever. On Ethereum, *you* wouldn't be collecting moss and dead flowers, you would flourish and live on the blockchain.This game would still be a play-to-earn game, in the form of LIFE tiles, or my idea, $TILE coin, which would not only be a nice way of earning some crypto, but actually have sentimental value to *you*. These tile coins and NFTs would be a memory that you and Ethereum users will never forget.Wrapping up, is this a good idea? Would you play the game? Would you be comfortable to sharing life events like this for the rewards and memory you receive?Let me know your thoughts in the comments below! I will, also, be ensuring that this game is free-to-play with the optional fun of earning more $TILE with NFTs that are fairly priced ($10-50).",False,The Game of Life | On Ethereum | Thoughts?,,0,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/111llxh/the_game_of_life_on_ethereum_thoughts/,[]

In other words, SMT solvers determine whether a given logical formula can be true or false based on a set of logical and mathematical rules.SMT solvers are used in various applications such as software verification, formal verification of hardware designs, optimization, and automated theorem proving. They are highly effective in solving complex logical problems, as they can make use of efficient algorithms, heuristics, and decision procedures to explore the space of possible solutions.Read more -> [SMTChecker and SMT Solvers: Exploring Formal Verification One Step at a Time](https://www.truscova.com/blog_article_7.php)",False,SMTChecker and SMT Solvers: Exploring Formal Verification One Step at a Time,,0,17,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/111h3od/smtchecker_and_smt_solvers_exploring_formal/,[]

The case was that users that submitted data through private smart contracts could be issued a confidential NFT, and then the holders of these data NFTs would be paid whenever their data was used (differential privacy (it basically adds noise) would secure it and only deliver an aggregated form of the data to the ones pulling it, so the sensitive information would still remain confidential) they'd be paid in tokens.

Despite the bear market of 2022 and its lower gas prices, deflationary effects are already being seen.And it gets even better! As gas prices increase, so will the deflation of ETH.

It essentially acts as collateral; if a validator does something bad like propose two blocks at once, they'll lose some of their currency at stake (or be slashed, in other words).Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) allow staked funds to be liquid and available for other uses. This is done by issuing tokens that represent the ETH being staked. When someone stakes ETH with a LSD provider, they'll receive (ERC-20) tokens that allow for the redemption of their deposit. https://preview.redd.it/l9y99klewdha1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b80e5d2972df8035ce834ffb31f28d429ef7ea7bLSDs existed on other chains before Ethereum, including Kusama/Polkadot for example, where unstaking can involve a 28-day wait period. The reason for LSDs popularity on Ethereum is that until recently, it's been unclear when withdrawals/unstaking would become possible. Ethereum withdrawals are now confirmed to be coming with the Shanghai upgrade in March and will be covered in more detail in a future write-up.&#x200B;# How LSDs WorkMost LSDs follow the [cToken model](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/). When you stake 1 ETH, you'll receive a token representing your deposit, 1 *token*ETH. The deposited ETH is pooled together, and grows as it accumulates rewards. You can redeem your deposit and share of rewards by exchanging *token*ETH back for ETH.In LSD systems, there isn't a 1:1 ratio between the token and the staked asset. There will always be less of the *token*ETH than ETH. As ETH the staked grows with rewards, the amount that can be redeemed with *token*ETH does as well. This is the reason why LSD token prices aren't always the same price that ETH may be at a given time.https://preview.redd.it/t9sauu7qvdha1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdbe817242b9fa8ea4c1b04c5e3237d33df46069The alternative to LSD is staking on ETH and obtaining rewards on that staked ETH periodically. This can be through staking 32 ETH directly, or programs that offer staking but not a token in return. The rewards are paid out in ETH based on the validator's performance.For example, staking with Coinbase awards a user with a '~3% yield that is paid in ETH. Alternatively, once you stake with Coinbase you can choose to participate in the LSD and receive cbETH tokens. When you do that, you'll no longer directly accumulate ETH rewards, you'll redeem the cbETH for ETH instead for a share of the pools rewards.&#x200B;# LSD ProvidersDifferent LSD providers exist with varying pros and cons. According to [Beaconchain](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices), there are as many as 20 staking services to choose from, with up to 7 offering a LSD. Below are the major LSD providers and a quick explanation of each, from most to least centralized.https://preview.redd.it/jgwq2ltlwdha1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21462d3bd25d0a75ef9a189ab8bddd4edcaffc36# Centralized ExchangesThere exist centralized exchanges that offer LSDs, these are the most simple solutions but also the most expensive. Centralized exchanges can take up to 30% in fees - that's 30% of rewards that go to Coinbase before the rest are distributes amongst stakers.When staking with a centralized exchange, the nodes are operated entirely by their staff. Exchanges including Coinbase use the cToken model. It is worth noting that centralized exchanges required identity verification, or KYC, to exchange the LSD ETH for regular ETH.&#x200B;# LIDOLIDO is one of the first LSD providers on Ethereum. They allow anyone to stake any amount of ETH and receive stETH in return. ETH is distributed to potential validators that are appointed by the LIDO DAO. LIDO charges 10% of rewards, half goes to validators and the other half goes to a DAO treasury that can be used as needed.LIDO does not use the cToken model described above. Instead, oracles are selected by the DAO to aggregate the balances of all validators using LIDO ETH. Then, based on whether there is a net increase or decrease, the supply of stETH is adjusted. If a day ends with more rewards, some stETH is issued. If not, some stETH is burned. stETH supply is adjusted this way daily.&#x200B;# Rocket PoolRocket Pool has two groups of independent participants, stakers and node operators. Node operators must have at least 16 ETH, and stakers can deposit any amount they'd like. Node operators are complemented with 16 ETH from stakers, which is used to set up a validator node. Node operators take 15% of rewards generated for ETH they stake on behalf of others.In Rocket Pool's case, only stakers are given the rETH LSD, not node operators. This means that node operators obtain their yield directly, whereas stakers receive their reward the LSD way: by exchanging rETH for ETH. Rocket Pool's LSD uses the cToken model. With the upcoming Atlas upgrade, Rocket Pool will allow node operators to participate by depositing 8 ETH instead of the current 16.&#x200B;# In ConclusionLSDs offer an opportunity to be in two places at once. ETH can accrue yield through staking, and a token equivalent can be used in DeFi to generate additional yield. The flexibility of LSDs make them an attractive option for many stakers getting started. They come at the cost of some reward fees lost, but the benefit is the flexibility and lack of a need to set up a validator node at home.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/i2kx6c0cwdha1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d69c3ff1286c9df134d3fd5b7875c5e3ea70d77bIt is my hope that LSD providers make staking more accessible, but that more people are able (and willing) to set up their own nodes in the future. There is a serious risk in centralized LSD providers having too much of the ETH staked, but they enable participation in staking for many starting out. &#x200B;Thanks a lot for reading!

Does Ethereum only care about enriching those who are already wealthy? Defi and the world computer are supposed to be for everybody, right?

Accessed with special devices, virtual reality, and augmented reality. That makes it an effectively immersive user experience. Well, that would've been great to have.  We already have some great games that are 'metaverse games', NFTs are an integral part of metaverse gaming because it brings value to virtual objects in the real world.

That being said, I do think that, so far, Namada could be a reliable solution for a fast, secure, and private way to transfer assets whereby inter-blockchain privacy will only become a larger and more prominent issue as mass adoption takes place.On that note, I'll leave you a final message- Only as a collective shall our privacy be restored.",False,Namada's RPGF Privacy for Ethereum,,0,74,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/10y1utc/namadas_rpgf_privacy_for_ethereum/,[]

And if people were to escalate by using vpns, the natural counter of using blacklists that prevent vpn addresses of known vpns from publishing to the eth blockchain creates a situation where someone could add addresses of people they dislike (like hackers or the north korean govt) to the blockchain to block access, and then it becomes a cat and mouse game of moving money by juggling ip addresses. But back to the basic premise. Would this assist in stopping the rampant theft occuring on the ethereum blockchain? Could the essence of this idea have safeguards added to it that cut out the potential bad part (along with the ensuing arms race) and still retain the core idea? For example, what if the majority of eth stakers had to agree to an unmasking of the IP address, and the ip address were protected behind encryption that could only be broken through mass consensus?

It makes financial policies, and directs the Financial Supervisory Service, an integrated financial regulator that examines and supervises financial institutions. According to the regulator, the digital assets that fit the characteristics of securities as defined in the Capital Markets Act, will be regulated as securities in the nation. It further explains that cryptocurrencies that offer a stake in business operations, and give holders rights to dividends, residual assets, or business profits, will fall under the category of securities under the Capital Markets Act.Reportedly, the securities regulations mandates public disclosure requirements and prohibit unfair trade practices to protect the rights of investors.However, sources reveal that the FSC said that cryptocurrencies that do not fall into the category of securities, however, will be regulated by the upcoming Framework Act on Digital Assets. Notably, the digital assets that do not have an issuer, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), will not be considered securities. The FSC will also permit Security Token Offerings (STOs) by making amendments to its Electronic Securities Act.In November Todayq News [reported](https://news.todayq.com/news/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-to-be-referred-exclusively-as-digital-assets-in-south-korea/) The Special Financial Transactions Act, which was introduced in 2021 by the South Korean government, gave legal status to the concept of digital assets. According to the law, digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum will no longer be referred to as cryptocurrencies but rather as Digital Assets. However, the FSC stated that token issuers and brokers, like crypto exchanges, will be required to assess which cryptocurrencies are securities on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to how companies have to self-determine whether they are issuing securities and follow the applicable regulations.South Korean authorities have eagerly looked forward to establishing regulation for crypto assets. They have marked it as a [priority](https://news.todayq.com/news/south-korean-regulator-prioritizes-crypto-regulation-in-their-2023-work-plan/) for their 2023 Work Plan.The Ministry of Justice in South Korea also revealed [plans](https://news.todayq.com/news/south-korean-authorities-want-a-crypto-transactions-tracker-to-go-after-criminals/) to develop a crypto-tracking system dubbed- Virtual Currency Tracking System- to tackle money laundering initiatives and recover funds linked to criminal activities. The country essentially seeks to monitor transaction history, extract transaction-related data, and check the source of funds before and after the remittance.Sources reveal that the newly built system is expected to be deployed in the first half of 2023. According to the South Korean ministry, the development of the tracking and analysis system will start in the second half of the year.source: [https://news.todayq.com/news/btc-and-eth-will-not-be-regulated-as-securities-in-south-korea/](https://news.todayq.com/news/btc-and-eth-will-not-be-regulated-as-securities-in-south-korea/)",False,BTC and ETH will not be regulated as securities in South Korea,,0,27,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/10v9chl/btc_and_eth_will_not_be_regulated_as_securities/,[]

Not just because more and better games are being produced but also because it's possible to make money while playing.    It can be difficult to know where to begin if you've always played video games but are new to blockchain games. Because of this, I was curious about which game you would suggest and what game you would play for the rest of your life if you must choose only one of them.    There are plenty of these games, such as StepN, DeFi Kingdoms, Splinterlands, Axie Infinity, Illuvium, Splinterlands, etc.     But I can't help myself choosing between Gods unchained and CoinFantasy, and maybe I prefer CoinFantasy because it introduced me to blockchain gaming and crypto in general.    How about you?     By virtually any metric used, I believe that Axie Infinity is the most popular NFT game today. What do you think of this game?    I believe it gained popularity because it was one of the best games when it was developed, but since there are now so many games available, I think there are a lot of games that are better than Axie.

And a privacy layer is exactly one such utility. Due to the open nature of blockchain one of the challenges that is commonly faced and needs to be tackled with for the wider adoption of web3 would be configurable privacy. You can't have complete privacy or else you just end up attracting the wrong kind of attention, both from those that are critical of blockchain, and naturally nefarious actors. But we still need privacy to protect users, and to avoid MEV running wild like what happened during the DeFi craze, and NFT minting during the NFT bubble. Front running is a real problem and having a privacy layer open to all EVM chains that can be easily integrated on EVM chains is in my opinion an important step to both protect users from MEV and also help it scale transactional costs. I don't know about you, but during the DeFi craze it wasn't uncommon to pay hundreds of dollars in gas when you were interacting with various liquidity pools on Ethereum, likely why the rise of other network sprang forth. And while it was nice to interact with them, I felt like the amount of scams, rug pulling and let's face it, out right ponzi schemes were rampant. I ended up losing money myself, and returned to dApps native on Ethereum, paying a higher price, but at least I felt safer. You may have noticed that privacy is getting more spotlights lately, even saw bloomberg's crypto twitter account tweeting about it, and Vitalik has recently co-authored a paper about it (Complete Knowledge: Preventing Encumbrance of Cryptographic Secrets) so a privacy layer that encompasses with the EVM built dApps that allows seamless messaging between the already built protocols with the privacy layer for preserving privacy is something that I personally am super hyped about.",False,There's going to be a privacy layer soon for EVM dApps.,,0,45,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/10vbhv7/theres_going_to_be_a_privacy_layer_soon_for_evm/,[]

Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

This passport as they call it provides an all-in-one way for gaming studios looking to onboard gamers into Web3.    The new tool is a non-custodial wallet, gamer profile, and authentication solution, similar to an Xbox Gamertag or an Apple ID, that does not require a password at sign-on.     I would say that this means that Immutable does not hold on to a user's private keys nor is it involved in signing transactions.   This would imply that Immutable doesn't store a user's private keys or participate in transaction signing.    I think this would promote adoption among larger groups of people, uphold enterprise-grade security, and provide access to useful player metrics. I like how the developers have finally realized that there are a number of things to do to make these games more secure and user-friendly.    I remember the first blockchain game I played was Axie Infinity as I believe many of you played at least at the beginning of your blockchain gaming career, these days I only play Coin Fantasy.    Blockchain-based gaming has made strides in recent months, with major companies like Ubisoft and Square Enix embracing crypto and NFT to create new revenue streams for creators which I was really hyped about when I heard the news since I played many Ubisoft games and I'm glad that they realized the potential of blockchain gaming.     Development and investment in Web3 gaming have also been significant, according to a report from blockchain data firm DappRadar I found online, which said that $748 million was raised in August 2022 for the development of new Web3 games.

But why do we have no standard for representing a map or process and an individual's journey through it?If you understand state machines, you will have no problem thinking of uses for them; they're a simple but versatile tool. But they aren't a common solution on the blockchain, most likely because there are no off-the-shelf solutions as there are for creating tokens. This is why I built Fismo. There is a twist to this implementation. Rather than multiple users pushing a single machine into different states, Fismo tracks each user's state in each machine. This makes it perfect for gating operations.For instance, you could have an NFT premint that only allows people who have reached a certain waypoint in a quest to mint. Waypoints in the quest are represented as states in a Fismo machine, and you can query any user's current state as well as their history. So reaching some waypoint is the threshold for minting, but states beyond that could determine how many NFTs the user can premint.- [Fismo source - GitHub](https://github.com/cliffhall/fismo)- [Fismo docs](https://docs.fismo.xyz)- [Fismology Lab - Fismo experiments](https://lab.fismo.xyz)- [Fismo JavaScript SDK - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fismo)- [Lockable Door demo - Polygon](https://lab.fismo.xyz/experiment/lockable-door.html)",False,Fismo - A State Machine Protocol for Ethereum (with a twist),,0,31,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/10q4myn/fismo_a_state_machine_protocol_for_ethereum_with/,[]

I find this number pretty amazing since this resulted in the NFT market value skyrocketing 122 times to $12.2 billion since 2020.  But the truth is that there were several high-profile hacks and collapses that rocked the industry and had far-reaching consequences for the global financial system. Of all the protocol hacks that 2022 experienced, Ronin Bridge is considered to be the largest one, exploiting $625 million, followed by the Binance Bridge hack, which compromised around $570 million. FTX is close behind, with $477 million exploited.  Meanwhile, the study shows that scam has been the most prevalent criminal activity over the years, frequently accounting for 50% or more of all other criminal activities.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.**How can I stake my ETH?**The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask.

All of those that I've visited so far employed a pretty primitive scam -- they offered to swap these tokens for ETH, USDC, USDT, etc, and then they would ask for unlimited access to your ETH, USDC, etc. If a user is careless and clicks 'approve' without reading MetaMask transaction details, then the coins would be gone.So, in the not so distant past, all those transactions would call method 'approve' from the coin's respective smart contract, which was easy to spot. Lately, however, I encountered another way to grant access to tokens -- something that doesn't scream in your face 'give me all your tokens'.1. One scammy website asked me to *sign* a non-readable hex data. After I did, they submitted this signed data via ***executeMetaTransaction*** function, which gave unlimited USDT access to a 3rd-party address. My assumption was that they created a raw unsigned approve transaction, which I signed, and which was then submitted to the chain.2. Another scammy website asked me to approve a transaction that was branded by MetaMask as 'Increase Allowance' (for USDT). There were no other details such as the USDT amount. After I approved this transaction (which required a gas fee), I saw that I granted access to 1,999,999 USDT to a 3rd-party address. After I examined the transaction, I saw that I made a call to ***increaseAllowance*** method of the USDT contract.So, two different methods that have the same end result. While I kind of understand how method #1 works, I am not so sure about method #2. Does this ***increaseallowance*** function belong to the USDT smart contract? If so, why does this smart contract even have it? It already has a required EIP-20 method ***approve***, which is much safer to use for users.***Note***: this all was done on the Polygon network.",False,Question about approving access to ERC-20 tokens,,0,27,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/10n82rd/question_about_approving_access_to_erc20_tokens/,[]

Blockchains are made for transfering assets and often there is a lack of transparency and accessibility, which blockchains solve perfectly. With coming regulations, companies will be less afraid to tokenize their stocks and other assets.Identity Management won't be a big deal for new money, but IMO another big reason to use Blockchains in the first place.
